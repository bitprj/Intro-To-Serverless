## Week 1 Step 5

### The Blog
## **Week 1**

Below is a written format of the livestream for this week, included for future reference. **To move on, close this issue.**

Last week, you should've learned how to use GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and deploy a simle Azure function.

### **Learning Objectives**

- navigating your cabin in GitHub
- downloading Visual Studio Code and installing extensions
- deploying a simple Azure function

### **Livestream**

In the livestream, we're going to set up your cabin, Visual Studio Code, and create an Azure function resource.

- For the full video, look in the [video folder](https://github.com/emsesc/bitcamp-serverless/blob/master/week2/livestream/videos).
- For the full code, look in the [code folder](https://github.com/emsesc/bitcamp-serverless/blob/master/week2/livestream/code).

**We'll be going over how to:**

1. enroll in/complete the GitHub course
2. download Visual Studio Code
3. install extentions in Visual Studio Code
4. set up a resource folder in Azure functions
5. deploy a simple HTTP trigger function in Azure

## 📝 Review: setting up Visual Studio Code

<details>
<summary>:computer: Download VSCode and install some extentions!</summary>
  </br>
  
**Visual Studio Code (or VSCode) was downloaded from this link: https://code.visualstudio.com**

Inside VSCode, you downloaded four extensions: **Azure Account, Azure App Service, Azure Functions, and Live Server.** All of the Azure extensions allow you to work on your Azure Function App in VS code instead of working directly through the Microsoft portal. Live Server is a quick and temporary testing server, and you can use it to test HTML pages. To launch, right click on your html file and press "Open with Live Server" or click "Go Live" in the bottom right corner:

## 🖥️ Navigating GitHub and GitHub desktop

For the GitHub portion of the week, there are two core things to remember:

1. repositories
2. committing changes

<details>
<summary>:question: What are those again?</summary>
  </br>
  
Repositories (or repos) are essentially **folders where you can store files of code.** The repo of our camp was duplicated into your account when you clicked "Create Template" so that you can commit changes and complete each lesson.

For our camp, each week is placed inside an issue. Only when you complete the week (committing the necessary code and commenting), will the issue close and you can move on to the next issue. Don’t worry – committing changes is easier than it sounds.

<details>
<summary>:exclamation: How can I use GitHub Desktop to commit my code?</summary>
  </br>
  
1. Download GitHub desktop. This is one way you can commit changes to the cabin repo to complete each lesson here.
2. To have access to the cabin repository on GitHub desktop, the name of your repo needs to be entered in the top-left corner in the box with placeholder “Filter” and “Clone Repository” should be selected.

3. Click “Pull Origin” once the repo is cloned to pull to GitHub desktop the most current version of the learning lab.
4. Open VSCode by clicking the button “Open in Visual Studio Code”. The files in the learning lab will be opened in VS code, and now you can complete the lesson (adding the necessary code). You need to add your code in a new file, so make sure you create a new file under the folder in VSCode. When you are done creating your new file and adding the necessary code, save the file and return to GitHub desktop.
5. The change will be shown. Add a summary and description of your change and then click “Commit to main”. Next, click “Push origin”, to push the change made in VSCode to the website.

*Remember, each step and lesson is posted on the repo on github.com. You will commit changes when the lesson instructs you to, and once you click “Push origin” and refresh the GitHub page, the issue will close and you can move on.*

## ⚡️ Navigating the Azure Portal

Working with Azure Functions was the biggest task of the week (and vital to the next weeks).

<details>
<summary>:exclamation: How can I create a resource and deploy a simple HTTP trigger function with it?</summary>
  </br>
  
1. Click “Create a resource” in your portal (near the top left of the screen)

<img width="1134" alt="resourceCreate" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70852990/104529849-a6859000-55d8-11eb-9d4e-335f21c94776.png">

2. Choose “Function App” (it should be in the list of popular resources, with the lightning logo)

<img width="589" alt="FunctionApp" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70852990/104529847-a5ecf980-55d8-11eb-8ca2-b739ea386472.png">

3. Create a new resource group, with a unique resource name (make it relevant to what the app does). Add a unique Function App name as well.
4. Make sure the "Code" button is selected next to Publish, the Runtime stack is Node.js, and the Version selected is 12 LTS

<img width="763" alt="codeDocker" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70852990/104529846-a5ecf980-55d8-11eb-8883-a128333c4bff.png">

5. Select your region
6. All of the other tabs in this step should be correctly filled (you can double-check them if you want), so you should be ready to click “Create”
7. Deploying may take a few minutes – be patient!
8. Once the function is deployed, open it and go to the “Functions” tap on the left (with symbol {fx}).
9. Click “Add” on this page, and then “HTTP trigger” (in the side window that opens)
10. Click “Add” (at the bottom of the side window) – creating this HTTP trigger may take a few seconds, so remember: patience!

<img width="1167" alt="httpTrigger" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70852990/104529848-a6859000-55d8-11eb-902d-f77bfd3df12a.png">

11. Once this trigger is created, it should open automatically. Click the “Code + Test” tab on the left side, and the code should open.

<img width="1440" alt="code+Test" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70852990/104529845-a5ecf980-55d8-11eb-9c88-64e6e5065a2a.png">

12. If you need to review the code we created, review the livestream.
13. Click “Save” and “Refresh” (in that order, and refresh only once the trigger has completely saved) when you have finished writing your code (or in between – it never hurts).
14. Click “Test/Run” once you are ready to try out your new trigger function. If it all works smoothly, and the code has no errors, you should receive the correct time based on the information inputted!

*One more tip: don’t forget to save! Rewriting code can be challenging and extremely frustrating, so save yourself the trouble!*
