## Let me in!

### ✅ Tasks:
- [ ] Run `git pull`
- [ ] Add on to the HTTP Trigger in the previous issue to check if the user’s parameter input of “password” equals `letmein`. If it does, output "Access granted."
- [ ] If it doesn’t equal the correct password, the function should output “Access denied.”
- [ ] Commit the update function's code in a file named `HackerVoice/index.js` to the root of the `week1` branch!

:exclamation: Make sure you follow the *exact* response we provided. `Access denied.` and `Access granted.`
### 🚧 Test your Work
When you paste your **Function URL** in your browser or make a GET request with **Postman** with a password parameter of letmein, you should get “Access granted.“. Otherwise, your function should output “Access denied.“.

### Returning from a function?
Now that we've got the user's result, either `Access denied.` or `Access granted.`, we have to get it to them somehow. **We can do this by returning it in the body of the request!**

> :bulb: Recall the `context.res` object we saw in the HTTP Trigger template.

```js
context.res = {
    // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
    body: your_response
};
```
Place your message to the user in `your_response`!

### Guidelines
The function should output the following responses according to whichever case is true:
- Password is correct (letmein): `Access granted.`
- Password is incorrect: `Access denied.`
