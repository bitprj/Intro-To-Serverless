## Week 1 Step 5

### One Cat Isn't Enough

## More practice with Azure Functions

*This week, you will be going through steps to set up tools needed to be successful in this camp. If you are already familiar with some, feel free to skip to the end and complete the task to move on.*

Get started by creating another new HTTP Trigger Azure Function with the already created Function App.

### **:pencil: Task 5: Create and deploy an HTTP trigger Azure Function that outputs TWO randomly generated cat pictures from the cat API and TWO names from the list below.**

#### Information required to complete task:
* API endpoint: https://cataas.com/cat/cute/says/Bitcamp
* List of names: "Shreya, Emily, Fifi, Beau, Evelyn, Julia, Daniel, Fardeen"

You should return the images in **JSON format** in the body.
```js
    body: {
        cat1: your-first-catpicture-in-base64,
        cat2: your-second-catpicture-in-base64,
        names: [name1, name2]
    }
```

#### Return your images encoded in base64!

<details>
<summary>:exclamation: Excuse me, base64? Why and how would I do that?</summary>
    </br>

```js
base64data = Buffer.from(originaldata).toString('base64')
//put what you want to turn into base64 inside "original data"
//"originaldata" will be encoded in base64.
```

#### **What even is base64? It looks like gibberish.**
Base64 is *just another way to represent data.* We can also represent the number 11 or 0 in base64. Remember that the images you see on your screen are actually just numbers!

#### **What's the real world application?**
When we're coding websites, we can use base64 to display images on websites. The base64 outputted from your API can be used to create this:

Base64 encoding allows programs to encode binary data into text (ASCII characters) in order to prevent data loss. We do this since there are certain transfer channels that only reliably transfer text data, and this encoding method allows us to safely transfer images in the form of text.

**For fun:** Once your API successfully returns the images in *base64*, you can see what they look like using [this](https://base64.guru/converter/decode/image) website.

<summary>:exclamation: How can I make a request to the cat API?</summary>
    </br>

**Hint:** You should try using the `node-fetch` module, but there are many other ways to do it as you can see [here](https://www.twilio.com/blog/5-ways-to-make-http-requests-in-node-js-using-async-await).

<details>
<summary>🔵 I'm still a little lost, some more help would be great!</summary>
    </br>

1. Let's use the `node-fetch` module for this task. Install it on your Azure Portal console:

**Step 1: Install the module**
In the left tab, scroll down to **Console**.

![console](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52464195/93178238-cf5c4e00-f6e8-11ea-90ab-c42f746cf04e.png)

Enter these commands in order:

```sh
npm init -y 

npm install node-fetch
```
*If you're confused about what this "package" thing is, we'll explain more in depth in the next step.*

**Step 2: Add it to your code**
Add this line of code to reference the module at the top of your code:
`const fetch = require('node-fetch)`

2. Time to make the request!

```js
let resp = await fetch(THE_ENDPOINT, {
    method: 'GET'
});

let data = await resp.arrayBuffer()
// we need to receive it as a buffer since this is an image we are receiving from the API
// Buffer?? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob
```
**Your turn!** What should you place in place of `THE_ENDPOINT`? Change the code.
> **Tip:** You're going to have to make two of these requests, so create two *different variables* for each request to get a different picture.

<summary>:exclamation: How can I select random items out of a list?</summary>
    </br>

**Hint 1:** You'll need to create an array with the names first.
**Hint 2:** You'll need to generate a random number within the range of the array length.

<details>
<summary>🔵 I'm still a little lost, some more help would be great!</summary>
    </br>

1. Create an array with the names:
```js
var names = ["name1", "name2"...]
```

2. Generate a random value in the correct range:
```js
var random_value = Math.floor(names.length * Math.random())
```

3. Get the name!
```js
var resultname = names[random_value]
```
*Do this two times to get two names!*

<details>
<summary>:exclamation: Now that I've got everything, how do I return it?</summary>
    </br>

`context.res` is the key to answering this question!

To return your two images and two names in the output:
```js
context.res = {
    body: {
        cat1: your-first-catpicture-in-base64,
        cat2: your-second-catpicture-in-base64,
        names: [name1, name2]
    }
}
```
<br><br/>
</details>

<details>
<summary>:exclamation: How should I test it?</summary>
    </br>

**Option 1:**
Paste the *function url* directly in your browser. Text with the current time should appear.

**Option 2:**
Use **Postman**! Paste the *function url* and make a GET request. In the output box, you should get your desired output:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69332964/113361613-63ef6c00-931a-11eb-9380-7d58a3dea1b4.png)
*Note: This image does not contain the desired output for this task.*

## **:camping: To move on, place your function URL in a [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) called `SECOND_ENDPOINT` so we can check your function. Remember to commit the function's code in a file named `twocatz.js` to the root of the `week1` branch!**

*Note: Every time you make a new commit to `week1`, we will check your function by making a request.*

    </br>

[Here are some steps:](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)  
1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under your repository name, click `Settings`.
![settings](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/repo-actions-settings.png)
