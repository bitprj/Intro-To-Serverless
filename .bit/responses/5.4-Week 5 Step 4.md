## Timeline

### ‚úÖ  Task:

- [ ] Develop a draft of your timeline in a new file called "timeline.md" in the projects folder
- [ ] Ask a mentor to review your gameplan
- [ ] Commit your gameplan.md file to the  `week5` branch to move on

### Developing a timeline

Before you start to code, you need to have a overaching plan on how you will build your project. It is completely okay (in fact, probably inevitable), for your plan to change once you start developing, but you still need a place to start.

### Where to start

Look back at your checklist and decide where you want to start developing your project. Do you want to start with:
- UI of the app/webapp
- Azure function
- API implementation

Sometimes it's best to start with the most difficult part, so you have time to debug and work with others to complete it.

### Scheduling deadlines

Speak with your mentor to make sure you can develop your timeline to maximize your timeline. Keep in mind that there will be many times when you might not be able to meet your own deadlines. How will you deal with this? Do you have enough buffer time allotted in your timeline for when things don't go according to plan?

Sometimes you might become lucky and end up having extra time on your hands. How do you plan on maximizing the impact of this time so you can ship the best version of your project at the end?

Be clearn on how to manage your own time and hold yourself accountable! Ask your peers and friends for help if you need it.
