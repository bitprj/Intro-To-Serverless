## Visualizing the Project

## :pencil: Task: Create a Flowchart

### Flowchart

Create a flowchart on [draw.io](draw.io) that demonstrates how you will implement your solution. Your flowchart should show all APIs (including your Azure Function) that you will be using, and what data is being passed between each step.

### Getting Started:

Think about your overall project and try to break it down into components, or sets of code that interact with each other. If you're having trouble breaking it down, think of the project as a roadmap or sequence of steps starting at the user.

What is the first thing the user does or interacts with? From there, trace through what happens from start to end. Each component should have an input and output that you can denote with arrows in the flowchart.

Make sure to think about the project carefully. It's easy to make a mistake and accidentally have one component that should actually be multiple, and vice versa.

If an input is being modified multiple times within a component, maybe it should actually be a few components that have their own inputs and outputs. On the other hand, if you can't think of an input and output for a specific component, consider combining it with something else.

Here are some more examples:
