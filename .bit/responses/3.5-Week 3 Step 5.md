## 📝 Review: Using HTML and CSS

After watching the live demo, you should know the basics of how to create a simple website using the coding language, HTML, and some CSS if you want your webpage to look fancy. Now, we want to create our own HTML page that inputs an image using a `<form>` and outputs the image's facial hair data.

If you still need some help learning HTML and CSS, checkout these resources:

- [W3Schools (HTML)](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
- [W3Schools (CSS)](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)

## 💻 Creating an HTML Page

We need to create the following HTML items. (Important: please use the exact same ID's specified, as we'll be referencing these in our JS code)

1. `header` element that says anything you want. For example, mine says **Example Project**
2. `div` element with id `container` that will surround all of your elements.
   1. `form` element with id `image-form`, with `onsubmit="handle(event)"`. Set the `enctype` attribute to `multipart/form-data`. Remember that for forms that receive file uploads, we need to specify this type of encoding.
          
       * The following three elements are contained within the form element:

         * `input` element that allows a file upload, where the user will upload an image. 

           * [This link](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp) could be helpful.

           * Set the `onChange` attribute to `"loadFile(event)"`. Use the `accept` attribute to only allow image submissions. Finally, set the `name` attribute to `image`.

          * `img` element with id `output`. This is going to display the image that the user selects.

          * `button` element with the `type` attribute set to `submit`. The text inside should say "Submit Picture" or something similar. This will submit the image.

   2. Empty `div` with the id `facial-hair`. This is where the facial hair analysis results will be displayed.

Finally, we'll reference jQuery.

```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="../../assets/js/vendor/jquery.min.js"><\/script>')</script>

<script src="config.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

To test your page out locally, first make sure you have [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) installed in VSCode. To start a local server, click `Go live` as shown below.

## 😊 Displaying Facial Hair Data

Now we'll need to read in the JSON file and output the facial hair onto our page.

The first thing we need to do is create a function called `loadFile(event) {}` which creates a variable called `image` that gets the ID `"output"` and displays the image the user uploaded. To do this, we need to get the element ID by using `document.getElementByID(id)`.

We also need to call for the image source using `.createObjectURL(event.target.files[0])`. Use `.src` on the image variable and call for the first file uploaded using the code above. When it's all put together, it should look something like this:

```javascript
function loadFile(event) {
    var image = document.getElementById('output')
    image.src = URL.createObjectURL(event.target.files[0])
}
```

Now we need to create our main function called `handle(event) {}`. This will take in the response; then, using the data from the Face API, it will create a new form that includes the various facial hair and their corresponding numerical values.

1. Using [jQuery](http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/jquery-basics), target the output element ID and change the content to equal "Loading". Then add the line, `event.preventDefault();` to disable the ability to reload the page. To event target with jQuery, use this sample:

   ```javascript
   console.log("submitting...")
   $('#facial-hair').html('Loading...');
   event.preventDefault();
   ```

2. After telling our HTML to show the content "Loading", we need to set a few variables to create a new form with our facial hair data. We can do this by adding a variable set to an element ID and creating a new `FormData` object based on the received information:

   ```javascript
   var myForm = document.getElementById('image-form');
   var payload = new FormData(myForm);
   
   const resp = await fetch(functionURL, {
       method: 'POST',
       body: payload,
   });
   ```

3. Next, we have to add a variable for the JSON data. Make a new variable called `data` and set it to the response JSON like we did earlier. We also need another variable, `beard`, which will be set to `data.result[0].faceAttributes.facialHair;`. This sets `beard` to the first result in our JSON data, and pulls the information out into a value. 

   ```javascript
   var data = await resp.json();
   var beard = data.analysis[0].faceAttributes.facialHair;
   ```

Lastly, we have to create the HTML that will actually be displayed:

i. First, create an `<h3>` tag for the title labelled `Facial Hair in image:` (make sure to add `<br />` at the end to skip a line)

ii. Now create 3 `<p>` tags that each show data for a different facial hair type. The list of types are moustache, sideburns, and beard. 

iii. To get the data, remember we set `var beard` to pull the first value. All we have to do is use jQuery and use this formatting.

   ```javascript
var resultString = `
<h3> Facial Hair in image:</h3> <br />
<p> Moustache: ${beard.moustache}</p>
<p> Sideburns: ${beard.sideburns}</p>
<p> Beard: ${beard.beard}</p>
`
   ```
The last thing we need to do is to use jQuery to change the facial hair div, `facial-hair`. 

   ```javascript
$('#facial-hair').html(resultString);
   ```
In the end, your `handle` function should look like this:

```javascript
async function handle(event) {
    console.log("submitting...")
    $('#facial-hair').html('Loading...');
    event.preventDefault();

    var myForm = document.getElementById('image-form');
    var payload = new FormData(myForm);

    const resp = await fetch(functionURL, {
        method: 'POST',
        body: payload,
    });

    var data = await resp.json();

    var beard = data.analysis[0].faceAttributes.facialHair;

    var resultString = `
    <h3> Facial Hair in image: </h3> <br />
    <p> Moustache: ${beard.moustache}</p>
    <p> Sideburns: ${beard.sideburns}</p>
    <p> Beard: ${beard.beard}</p>
    `
    
    $('#facial-hair').html(resultString);
}
```

## 😄 Deploying using Azure Static Web Apps

Now that we can display facial hair data and run our function locally, let's try deploying it onto the web so that everyone can access your website remotely. We'll be doing this through Azure Static Web Apps. 

First, make sure:

1.  All of your code is committed to GitHub.
2. The Azure Static Web Apps VSCode Extension is installed.

**Installing Azure Static Web Apps VSCode Extension**

1. In Visual Studio Code, open your GitHub repo.
2. Select the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the left. It should look like four squares, with the top right square separated from everyone else, like this:

   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49426183/103468402-c2f71200-4d26-11eb-9648-35b821b0666e.png)
   
3. Search for 'Azure Static Web Apps', and you should see the extension 'Azure Static Web Apps (Preview)'. Install this extension.

**Creating an Azure Static Web App**

1. Now, select the Azure logo in the Activity Bar on the left to open the Azure extensions window. It should look something like: 

   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49426183/103468430-e5892b00-4d26-11eb-9e13-cabd60e4b852.png)
   
   Note: Make sure you're signed into Azure and GitHub from Visual Studio Code. You should receive a prompt to sign in if you are not.
2. Hover over the **STATIC WEB APPS (PREVIEW)** label and click the plus sign to create a new one.
   1. Enter a name for your new web app.
      
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49426183/103468439-f46fdd80-4d26-11eb-8fea-3ab01e404887.png)
      
   2. Select the master branch.
      
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49426183/103468443-ffc30900-4d26-11eb-9b27-c868a085da15.png)
   
   3. You will then see "Select the location of your application code". This is searching for the location of the API in your application, but we will not have one in our case. Click the "/", and then select "Skip for now" should appear. However, if you plan to add an API, you can read more about it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/add-api).
      
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49426183/103468455-10737f00-4d27-11eb-9079-f29989377dfc.png)
   
   4. Now, you should see "Enter the path of your build output relative to your app's location". This is relevant if you are using certain frontend frameworks, but since we are using vanilla JS, we can simply clear the field and press Enter. However, if you *are* using a framework, such as Angular, React, or Vue, you can read more about its implementation at this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/getting-started?tabs=angular).
   
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49426183/103468460-1ec19b00-4d27-11eb-8598-e2c5b5f5c6b6.png)
      
   5. Select a location nearest you and press Enter.
3. Once your app has been created, a confirmation notification will appear in Visual Studio Code that says "Successfully created new static web app...".
4. Go back to the **STATIC WEB APPS (PREVIEW)** label and expand your subscription name underneath. You should see the name of your app. Right click and select *Open in Portal* to view the app in the Azure portal.
