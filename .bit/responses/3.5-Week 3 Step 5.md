Week 3 Step 5 ‚¨§‚¨§‚¨§‚¨§‚¨§‚óØ‚óØ‚óØ‚óØ | üïê Estimated completion: 10-20 minutes

# Download it!
*This week, you will be going through steps to create an HTTP Trigger that takes parameter inputs and returns a download link for the given image.*

## ‚úÖ  Task:

- [ ]  ***1:*** Create an HTTP Trigger Function named `bunnimage-download` that takes in "username" from the header
   - [ ]  Have the function query for image with the correct associated `username` from blob storage using `node-fetch`
   - [ ]  Have the function return an image download link in an attribute named `downloadUri`.
- [ ] ***2:*** Place your new HTTP Trigger function secret in the repository named `BUNNIMAGE_ENDPOINT2`
- [ ] ***3:*** Commit your new HTTP Trigger function code in `bunnimage-download/index.js` on the `bunnimage` branch
- [ ] ***4:*** Create a pull request to merge `bunnimage` onto `main`, and only merge the pull request when the bot approves your changes! 

## üöß Test Your Work

To test your work, use Postman to send a GET request with a "username" in the header. You should see a response similar to the below:

> :bulb: The username value should be the name of an image you have already uploaded to the blob storage. Do it fast, or your timer trigger will delete it!

```JSON
{
  "body" : {
     "downloadUri" : "https://<YOUR_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>.blob.core.windows.net/images/<USERNAME>.png",
     "success": true
  }
}
```
> üí° Yay! This means you successfully fetched a download link to your image.

## 1: Modifying your Function

In our `module.exports` function, we'll want to:

1. Use the `node-fetch` package we installed earlier this week to determine if the requested image is available.

2. Use if-else statements to determine the success of the retrieval. Remember to test for both jpeg and png extentions!

3. Send back a JSON object containing the download link.

<details>
<summary>‚ùì How do I use fetch to test extensions?</summary>

Outside of the main function, you'll first want to create a variable called `fetch` that calls your `node-fetch` package: `const fetch = require("node-fetch");`. 

Then, within your main function, you'll need to create references to your username as well as variables for `download`, `downloadpng`, and `downloadjpg`. Since we don't know whether the image is a png or jpeg file, we need to test for both.

```js
const username = req.headers['username'];
let download = ""
let downloadpng = "https://<YOUR_BLOB_STORAGE_URL>.blob.core.windows.net/images/" + username + ".png";
let downloadjpg = "https://<YOUR_BLOB_STORAGE_URL>.blob.core.windows.net/images/" + username + ".jpeg";
```

To attempt to download the image, call `fetch` asynchronously. This way, we can test all possible links to the image and determine which one works.

```js
let pngresp = await fetch(downloadpng, {
   method: 'GET',
})
let pngdata = await pngresp;

let jpgresp = await fetch(downloadjpg, {
   method: 'GET',
})
let jpgdata = await jpgresp;
```

<details>
<summary>‚ùì How do I determine the right image link?</summary>

Your data will contain an attribute "status text" that lets you know if a blob doesn't exist. To use these to our advantage, we can create if-else statements that notify us if our `fetch` method was successful.

```js
if (pngdata.statusText == "The specified blob does not exist." && jpgdata.statusText == "The specified blob does not exist." ) {
   success = false;
   context.log("Does not exist: " + pngdata)
   context.log("Does not exist: " + jpgdata)
} else if (pngdata.statusText != "The specified blob does not exist.") {
   success = true;
   download = downloadpng
   context.log("Does exist: " + pngdata)
} else if (jpgdata.statusText != "The specified blob does not exist.") {
   success = true;
   download = downloadjpg
   context.log("Does exist: " + jpgdata)
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>‚ùì How do I return the download link?</summary>

To return the download link, just set `context.res` to a JSON object with your download link.

```js
context.res = {
      body: {
               "downloadUri" : download,
               "success": success,
      }
};
context.log(download);
context.done();
```
