Week 3 Step 5 ‚¨§‚¨§‚¨§‚¨§‚¨§‚óØ‚óØ‚óØ‚óØ | üïê Estimated completion: 10-20 minutes

# Download it!
*This week, you will be going through steps to create an HTTP Trigger that takes parameter inputs and returns a download link for the given image.*

## ‚úÖ  Task:

- [ ]  1. Create an HTTP Trigger Function that takes in "username" as header input and base64 image in the body
   - [ ]  Have the function query for image with the correct associated `username` from blob storage using `node-fetch`
   - [ ]  Have the function return an image download link.
- [ ]  üöÄ Place your new HTTP Trigger function secret in the repository named `BUNNIMAGE_ENDPOINT2`
- [ ]  üöÄ Commit your new HTTP Trigger function code in `bunnimage/download.js` on the `bunnimage` branch

## üöß Test Your Work

To test your work, use Postman to send a POST request with an image attached. You should see a response similar to the below:

```JSON
{
  "body" : {
     "downloadUri" : "https://<YOUR_BLOB_STORAGE_URL>.blob.core.windows.net/images/<USERNAME>.png",
     "success": true
  }
}
```
> üí° Yay! This means you successfully fetched a download link to your image.

</br>

1. Set your request method to `POST`.

2. You will need to send body data with your request. The Body tab in Postman allows you to specify the data you need to send with a request. You can send various different types of body data to suit your API. Website forms often send data to APIs as multipart/form-data. You can replicate this in Postman using the form-data Body tab. Be sure to check File instead of Text, since we'll be posting an image instead of a JSON object.

## 1. Modifying your Function

In our `module.exports` function, we'll want to:

1. Use the `node-fetch` package we installed earlier this week to fetch our image.

2. Use if-else statements to determine the success of our download and catch any extraneous errors.

3. Send back a JSON object containing the download link.

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I fetch the image?</summary>

Outside of the main function, you'll first want to create a variable called `fetch` that calls your `node-fetch` package: `var fetch = require("node-fetch");`. 

Then, within your main function, you'll need to create references to your username as well as variables for `download`, `downloadpng`, and `downloadjpg`. Since we don't know whether the image is a png or jpeg file, we need to test for both.

```js
var username = req.headers['username'];
var download = ""
var downloadpng = "https://<YOUR_BLOB_STORAGE_URL>.blob.core.windows.net/images/" + username + ".png";
var downloadjpg = "https://<YOUR_BLOB_STORAGE_URL>.blob.core.windows.net/images/" + username + ".jpeg";
```

Finally, to fetch your image, call `fetch` asynchronously.

```js
let pngresp = await fetch(downloadpng, {
   method: 'GET',
})
let pngdata = await pngresp;

let jpgresp = await fetch(downloadjpg, {
   method: 'GET',
})
let jpgdata = await jpgresp;
```

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I catch download errors?</summary>

Your data will contain an attribute "status text" that lets you know if a blob doesn't exist. To use these to our advantage, we can create if-else statements that notify us if our `fetch` method was successful.

```js
if (pngdata.statusText == "The specified blob does not exist." && jpgdata.statusText == "The specified blob does not exist." ) {
   success = false;
   context.log("Does not exist: " + pngdata)
   context.log("Does not exist: " + jpgdata)
} else if (pngdata.statusText != "The specified blob does not exist.") {
   success = true;
   download = downloadpng
   context.log("Does exist: " + pngdata)
} else if (jpgdata.statusText != "The specified blob does not exist.") {
   success = true;
   download = downloadjpg
   context.log("Does exist: " + jpgdata)
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I return the download link?</summary>

To return the download link, just set `context.res` to a JSON object with your download link.

```js
context.res = {
      body: {
               "downloadUri" : download,
               "success": success,
      }
};
context.log(download);
context.done();
```
