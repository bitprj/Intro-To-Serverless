## Week 3 Step 5

### **Week 3 Blog**

Below is a written format of the livestream for this week, included for future reference. **To move on, close this issue.**


### Creating a Cosmos Account

If you've already created your Cosmos account, you can go ahead and skip this step. If not, open the dropdown below for more details on how to do so!

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I create a Cosmos account?</summary>

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Search for and select **Azure Cosmos DB**.
3. Select **Add**.
4. Fill in the information.
    1. Select your Azure subscription from the dropdown.
    2. Create a new resource group, and enter a unique name for it. I'll call mine `emotion_group`.
    3. Enter an **Account Name** that you'll use to identify your Azure Cosmos account. Because *documents.azure.com* is appended to the name that you provide to create your URI, use a unique name. This can be something like your GitHub username.
    4. The **API** determines what type of account you want to create. Azure Cosmos DB provides five APIs: Core (SQL) and MongoDB for document data, Gremlin for graph data, Azure Table, and Cassandra. We'll be leaving our API as **Core (SQL)** for now.
    5. For the **Location** that will be hosting your Cosmos account, select one from the dropdown that will be closest to your users. If you're not sure which location to pick, go ahead and select one that is closest to you.
    6. For capacity mode, [here's](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/throughput-serverless) a detailed comparison between **Provisioned throughput** and **Serverless (preview)**. We'll be sticking with **Provisioned throughput** since this is meant to be a small project that just demonstrates the functionality of Azure.
    7. We will keep the rest of the settings the same.

5. Click **Review + create**. Make sure all of the information is listed the way you want it, and click **Create**.
6. Wait for the portal page to display **Your deployment is complete**. Select **Go to resource** to go to the Azure Cosmos DB account page.

### Creating a Cosmos Database

Once you've created your Account, you can now create a database!

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I create a Cosmos database?</summary>

1. Navigate to your Azure Cosmos DB account page, and select **Data Explorer**.
2. Select **New Container**.
<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49426183/113165079-ad9f6000-920f-11eb-9b6a-8a84add3215d.png"></p>

3. Enter a **Database ID**. *Please write this ID down somewhere and mark it as your database ID! We will need it for later configuration.* I will call mine `emotion_database`.
4. Leave **Throughput** option as is.
5. Enter a **Container ID**. *Please also write this ID down somewhere and mark it as your container ID! We will need it for later configuration.* I will call mine `emotion_container`.
6. For our partition key, we can simply put down `/id` for now. With each data document you create, Azure will automatically assign some ID value to the document. We will see this in action later on.
<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49426183/113165734-28687b00-9210-11eb-8e6d-389f2305b298.png"></p>

7. Select **OK**.

</details>

<br>

### Setting Up Configuration

Now that we've created our Cosmos accout and database, we now need to set up our global variable configuration in code. Navigate to your source code in **VSCode**. 

1. Create a file named `config.js`.
2. Collect the following pieces of information:
   1. Your Cosmos DB Endpoint (this should look something like `https://yourcosmosaccountname.documents.azure.com:443/`)
   2. Your Subscription Key (Navigate to your cosmos db account page, go to **Overview** and find **Subscription ID**)
   3. Your Database ID (look at your previous comment!)
   4. Your Container ID (look at your previous comment!)

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49426183/113173610-906e8f80-9217-11eb-940e-aa669a45131b.png"></p>

3. Inside your `config.js` file, enter in the following code, filling in the necessary pieces of information you collected above.
```js
const config = {
  endpoint: "<YOUR COSMOS DB ENDPOINT>",
  key: "<YOUR SUBSCRIPTION KEY>",
  databaseId: "<YOUR DATABASE ID>",
  containerId: "<YOUR CONTAINER ID>",
  partitionKey: {kind: "Hash", paths: ["/id"]}
};
module.exports = config;
```
**:x: IMPORTANT REMINDER! *Never* commit and push your subscription key into github.**
<br>


### Setting Up Database Context

Configuration is set up! Now, we need to set up our database context. This will help us fetch our database and container using the global variables we set up in config, and create them in case they don't exist.

1. Create a file named `databaseContext.js`.
2. Fetch your configuration and Cosmos client using the following lines of code.
```js
const config = require("./config");
const CosmosClient = require("@azure/cosmos").CosmosClient;
```
3. Create an asynchronous function called `create` that we can call from our function to fetch/create our container and database in case they aren't accessible. It will take in the `client` that we grabbed in the earlier step, and the `databaseID` and `containerID` to know which container to search for.
```js
async function create(client, databaseId, containerId) 
{
   
}
```

4. Within the function, we'll want to call the function `createIfNotExists()` twice, once for the database and another for the container. Each one will create a database/container respectively given the databaseID/containerID. Read more about the function [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cosmos.table.cloudtable.createifnotexists?view=azure-dotnet).
```js
const { database } = await client.databases.createIfNotExists({
    id: config.databaseId
});

const { container } = await client
    .database(config.databaseId)
    .containers.createIfNotExists(
        { id: config.containerId, config.partitionKey },
        { offerThroughput: 400 }
    );
}
```

5. We've finished our `create` function! Now, we can export it.
```js
export default create;
```

<details>
<summary>:question: Confused?</summary>

Your `databaseContext.js` file should look like this in its entirety:

```js
const config = require("./config");
const CosmosClient = require("@azure/cosmos").CosmosClient;

async function create(client, databaseId, containerId) 
{
   const { database } = await client.databases.createIfNotExists({
      id: config.databaseId
   });

   const { container } = await client
      .database(config.databaseId)
      .containers.createIfNotExists(
         { id: config.containerId, config.partitionKey },
         { offerThroughput: 400 }
      );
   }
}

export default create;
```

</details>

<br>


### Modifying your Azure Function

Now that our database context and configuration is set up, all that is left to do is to modify our existing Azure function.

1. Navigate to your Azure function code in VSCode.
2. Create a new function `createDocument(newItem)` that will create a new document in the cosmos container given new data.
```js
async function createDocument(newItem) {

}
```

3. Within your function, grab your `endpoint`, `key`, `databaseId`, and `containerId` from the config file.
```js
var { endpoint, key, databaseId, containerId } = config;
```

4. From these global variables, fetch your CosmosClient, database, and container using your previously built `create()` function.
```js
const client = new CosmosClient({endpoint, key});
const database = client.database(databaseId);
const container = database.container(containerId);
await create(client, databaseId, containerId);
```

5. To complete the function, we now just need to create the new document!
```js
try {
   const {resource: createdItem} = await container.items.create(newItem);
} catch (err) {
   console.log(err.message);
}
```



<details>
<summary>Confused?</summary>

Your function should now look like this in its entirety.
```js
async function createDocument(newItem) {
    var { endpoint, key, databaseId, containerId } = config;
    const client = new CosmosClient({endpoint, key});
    const database = client.database(databaseId);
    const container = database.container(containerId);
    await create(client, databaseId, containerId);

    try {
        const {resource: createdItem} = await container.items.create(newItem);
    } catch (err) {
        console.log(err.message);
    }
}
```

</details>

<br>

6. To finish up, we'll add one final line to our `module.exports`. Right after you analyze your image, take the JSON result and call `createDocument(result)`. 

```js
//analyze the image
var result = await analyzeImage(parts[0].data);

// store analysis in cosmos
createDocument(result);

context.res = {
   body: {
      result
   }
};

```
