## Week 2 Step 2

### Before the Function can be used:

Before the Azure Function can run, we have to install all the necessary package dependencies. We will be using the `parse-multipart`  and `node-fetch` packages (more details on that later). These packages must be manually installed in the console using npm install.

At this point, you should have created a new HTTP trigger function in your Azure portal along with the Function App. If you have not done this, please do it now. Navigate to your Function App. **This is not the function code, but the actual app service resource**. 

[What is a package?](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_npm.asp)

In the left tab, scroll down to **Console**.

![console](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52464195/93178238-cf5c4e00-f6e8-11ea-90ab-c42f746cf04e.png)

Enter these commands in order:

```sh
npm init -y 

npm install parse-multipart

npm install node-fetch
```

The first creates a **package.json** file to store your dependencies. The next two actually install the necessary packages.

*Note: If you get red text like `WARN`, that is expected and normal*

You should be good to go! Reach out to your TA's if there are any issues!

**Once you are done, place the function URL of your new HTTP Trigger as a repository secret named `FUNCTION_URL` to move on.**
