# Upload it!
*This week, you will be going through steps to upload images to blob storage using Azure's SDK.*

## ✅  Task:

- [ ] ***1:*** Receive an image from a POST request using parse-multipart
- [ ] ***2:*** Upload an image using @azure/blob SDK by naming the image `test` + the correct file extension
- [ ] 🚀 Store your function url to your repository secrets with the name `BUNNIMAGE_ENDPOINT`, add your blob url to your repository secrets with the name `blob_url`, and commit your updated function code to `bunnimage/index.js` on the `bunnimage` branch

## 🚧 Test Your Work

To test your work, you'll be using Postman to send a POST request in Postman with an image in the body to your function url. You should see a response similar to the below:

```JSON
{
  "body" : "File Saved"
}
```
> 💡 Yay! This means it was successfully saved.

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I attach an image to my POST request?</summary>
</br>

1. Get your `bunnimage` function url

2. Use Postman to make a POST request to your functional url

3. You will need to send body data with your request:
    - The Body tab in Postman allows you to specify the data you need to send with a request
    - You can send various different types of body data to suit your API
    - Website forms often send data to APIs as multipart/form-data
    - You can replicate this in Postman using the form-data Body tab
    - Be sure to check File instead of Text, since we'll be posting an image instead of a JSON object

## Writing our *First* Azure Function to Upload an Image

<details>
<summary>:exclamation: How do I initialize packages in code?</summary>
</br>

1. Use this [tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings) to add in your own connection string from your storage container
    - The storage container is the one you created in step 1
    - Navigate to the container and find your connection string
2. Add the following lines of code to the top of your index.js file:
    ```js
    var multipart = require("parse-multipart")
    const connectionString = process.env.AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING;
    const { BlobServiceClient } = require("@azure/storage-blob");
    ```
    - Take note of the `process.env` value being assigned to `connectionString`. `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` is the name of the environment variable.

<summary>:question: How do I find my secret strings?</summary>
</br>

These are the same ones you added in your repository secrets in step 1. Here is a review:

- *Note: You'll need to store these strings in [environment variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-common) as well, if you don't want to accidentally commit them. You can access these with `process.env['thesecretname']`*

### 1. Reviewing `parse-multipart` to receive an image
In your main `module.exports` function, you'll want to use the `parse-multipart` library to parse the image from the POST request. Then you'll determine the fle extension, and then upload the file using an `uploadFile()` function we'll write later on.

<details>
<summary>:question: Can we review syntax for `parse-multipart`?</summary>
</br>

To parse a request's body, you can use the following lines of code:

```js
var boundary = multipart.getBoundary(req.headers['content-type']);
var body = req.body;
var parsedBody = multipart.Parse(body, boundary);
```

</details>

### 2. Uploading the image
Let's start out by writing the function we can call to upload an iamge.

⬇ **Uploading the image blob to your container**

Our `uploadFile` function will be an *asynchronous* function that uses the `BlobServiceClient` to get a reference to the container, create a blob, and upload the data to that blob.

<details>
<summary>:question: What should my parameters be?</summary>

The signature of your `uploadFile()` function should look something like:

```js
async function uploadFile(parsedBody, ext)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>:question: How can I get a reference to the container?</summary>

```js
const blobServiceClient = BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString(connectionString);
const containerName = "<YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME>";
const containerClient = blobServiceClient.getContainerClient(containerName);    // Get a reference to a container
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>:question: How can I create a blob?</summary>

```js
const blobName = 'test.' + ext;    // Create the container
const blockBlobClient = containerClient.getBlockBlobClient(blobName); // Get a block blob client
```
Based on previous code we've written and logic, fill in the blanks!

</details>

<details>
<summary>:question: How can I upload data to the blob?</summary>

```js
const uploadBlobResponse = await blockBlobClient.upload(parsedBody[0].data, parsedBody[0].data.length);
```

</details>

> :bulb: Be sure to `return` a string like "File Saved" from this function when the file has been uploaded!

#### Heading back to the `module.exports` main function

:exclamation: Name your image file as `test.png` or `test.jpg` (depending on the submitted file extension) in our code for testing purposes.

<details>
<summary>:question: How can I determine file extension?</summary>
</br>

You can use a series of if-else statements like the ones below:

```js
var filetype = parsedBody[0].type;
if (filetype == "image/png") {
    ext = "png";
} else if (filetype == "image/jpeg") {
    ext = "jpg";
} else {
    username = "invalidimage"
    ext = "";
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>:question: How can I upload the file?</summary>
</br>

In this case, we'll just call the `uploadFile()` function that we wrote earlier.

```js
var responseMessage = await uploadFile(parsedBody, ext);
context.res = {
    body: responseMessage
};
```

</details>

## 🚀 Add your Blob URL as a secret

You'll need to add your Blob URL to the github repository as a secret so we can test it! Name our secret to `blob_url` and set it equal to your blob url, which should look like "https://bunnimagestorage.blob.core.windows.net". To find your url, simply place your storage account name in this template:
```
https://<your account name>.blob.core.windows.net
```
