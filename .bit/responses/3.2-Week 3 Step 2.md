Week 3 Step 2 ⬤⬤◯◯◯◯◯◯◯ | 🕐 Estimated completion: 10-20 minutes

## Upload it!
*This week, you will be going through steps to upload images to blob storage using Azure's SDK.*

### ✅  Task:

- [ ]  Make sure you're on the `week3` branch
- [ ]  Receive an image from a POST request using parse-multipart
- [ ]  Upload an image using @azure/blob SDK by naming the image `test` + the correct file extension.
- [ ]  Add your function url to your repository secrets with the name `BUNNIMAGE_ENDPOINT`
- [ ]  Add your blob url to your repository secrets with the name `blob_url`
- [ ]  Commit your updated function code to `bunnimage/index.js`

### 🚧 Test Your Work

To test your work, you'll be using Postman to send a POST request in Postman with an image in the body to your function url. You should see a response similar to the below:

```JSON
{
  "body" : "File Saved"
}
```
> 💡 Yay! This means it was successfully saved.

<summary>:question: How do I attach an image to my POST request?</summary>
</br>

1. Set your request method to `POST`.

2. You will need to send body data with your request. The Body tab in Postman allows you to specify the data you need to send with a request. You can send various different types of body data to suit your API. Website forms often send data to APIs as multipart/form-data. You can replicate this in Postman using the form-data Body tab. Be sure to check File instead of Text, since we'll be posting an image instead of a JSON object.

</details>

You should also be able to see the image in your blob storage container!

### Installing Packages

Before we start coding the trigger, we need to install the following `npm` packages/libraries in the Function App we created in the previous step:

1. `parse-multipart`
2. `node-fetch`
3. `@azure/storage-blob`

> **Tip**: The Azure Storage Blob client library is going to be a key piece of the project. After all, it's about blobs!

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I install `npm` packages?</summary>
</br>

Click on the "Console" tab in the left panel under "Development Tools".

![https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69332964/99189070-59e31d00-272d-11eb-80a4-17444e5fac65.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69332964/99189070-59e31d00-272d-11eb-80a4-17444e5fac65.png)

Inside the console (shown on the right panel), type in the following commands:

`npm init -y` <br />
[`npm install parse-multipart`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse-multipart) <br />
[`npm install node-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) <br />
[`npm install @azure/storage-blob`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/storage-blob) <br />

</details>

### Writing our *First* Azure Function to Upload an Image

</br>

For the function to work, we have to initialize the packages/libraries we installed previously. In your function code at the very top add: 

```js
var multipart = require("parse-multipart")
const connectionString = process.env.AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING;
const { BlobServiceClient } = require("@azure/storage-blob");
```

Take note of the `process.env` value being assigned to `connectionstring` in the code (*Line 2*). Use this [tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings) to add in your own secret strings from your storage container. (The storage container is the one you created in step 1. Navigate to it and find your secret strings.)

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I find my secret strings?</summary>
</br>

You should have already added these in your repository secrets in step 1: here is a review.
![https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69332964/99161798-ba3d7480-26c3-11eb-8e55-eac4bd4cb174.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69332964/99161798-ba3d7480-26c3-11eb-8e55-eac4bd4cb174.png)

![https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69332964/99161822-ec4ed680-26c3-11eb-8977-f12beb496c24.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69332964/99161822-ec4ed680-26c3-11eb-8977-f12beb496c24.png)

- *Note: You'll need to store these strings in [environment variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-common) as well, if you don't want to accidentally commit them. You can access these with `process.env['thesecretname']`*

⬇ **The main block of code**

Be sure to name your image file as `test.png` or `test.jpg` (depending on the submitted file extension) in our code for testing purposes.

In your main `module.exports` function, you'll want to use the `parse-multipart` library to parse the image from the POST request. Then you'll determine the fle extension, and then upload the file using an `uploadFile()` function we'll write later on.

<details>
<summary>:question: Can we review syntax for `parse-multipart`?</summary>
</br>

To parse a request's body, you can use the following lines of code:

```js
var boundary = multipart.getBoundary(req.headers['content-type']);
var body = req.body;
var parsedBody = multipart.Parse(body, boundary);
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>:question: How can I determine file extension?</summary>
</br>

You can use a series of if-else statements like the ones below:

```js
var filetype = parsedBody[0].type;
if (filetype == "image/png") {
    ext = "png";
} else if (filetype == "image/jpeg") {
    ext = "jpg";
} else {
    username = "invalidimage"
    ext = "";
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>:question: How can I upload the file?</summary>
</br>

In this case, we'll just call the `uploadFile()` function that we'll be writing later on.

```js
var responseMessage = await uploadFile(parsedBody, ext);
context.res = {
    body: responseMessage
};
```

</details>

⬇ **Uploading the image blob to the "images" container**

Meanwhile, our `uploadFile` function will be an *asynchronous* function that uses the `BlobServiceClient` to get a reference to the container, create a blob, and upload the data to that blob.

<details>
<summary>:question: What should my parameters be?</summary>

The signature of your `uploadFile()` function should look something like:

```js
async function uploadFile(parsedBody, ext)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>:question: How can I get a reference to the container?</summary>

```js
const blobServiceClient = BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString(connectionString);
const containerName = "<YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME>";
const containerClient = blobServiceClient.getContainerClient(containerName);    // Get a reference to a container
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>:question: How can I create a blob?</summary>

```js
const blobName = 'test.' + ext;    // Create the container
const blockBlobClient = containerClient.getBlockBlobClient(blobName); // Get a block blob client
```
Based on previous code we've written and logic, fill in the blanks!

</details>

<details>
<summary>:question: How can I upload data to the blob?</summary>

```js
const uploadBlobResponse = await blockBlobClient.upload(parsedBody[0].data, parsedBody[0].data.length);
```

</details>

Be sure to return a string like "File Saved" to the main function when the file has been uploaded!

### Add your Blob URL as a secret

You'll need to add your Blob URL to the github repository as a secret so we can test it! Name our secret to `blob_url` and set it equal to your blob url, which should look like "https://bunnimagestorage.blob.core.windows.net". To find your url, simply place your storage account name in this template:
```
https://<your account name>.blob.core.windows.net.
```
