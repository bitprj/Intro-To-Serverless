# Building our first function ‚ö°[HackerVoice]

> Managing a server is pretty complicated. As a student, mastering serverless functions can help you to build projects that solve real-world problems by integrating APIs, constructing user interfaces, and analysing data without worrying about managing servers.

> [‚ö°Ô∏è 10 Ways to Use Serverless Functions](https://dev.to/aws/10-ways-to-use-serverless-functions-bme)

## ‚úÖ  Tasks:
- [ ] Run `git pull` and create a new branch called `hackervoice`
- [ ] ***1:*** Create an Azure account
- [ ] ***2:*** Set up Azure locally on VS Code
- [ ] ***3:*** Create an HTTP trigger Azure function that gets content from a request parameter called `password` and returns it in the function's body
- [ ] ***4:*** Test your function locally with Postman and, when you confirm that it works, deploy your function
- [ ] üöÄ Place your function URL in a [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) called `HACKERVOICE_ENDPOINT` and commit the function's code in a file named `HackerVoice/index.js` on the `hackervoice` branch
- [ ] üöÄ Create a pull request that merges `hackervoice` to `main`, but **do not merge it**

## üöß Test your Work
**Option 1:**
Paste the *function url* directly in your browser and add the query parameters to the end of the url: `&param_name=param_value`. Your inputted password value should appear.

**Option 2:**
Use **Postman**! Paste the *function url* and make a GET request. In the output box, you should receive the value you put in for the request parameter.

## 1: Create an Azure Account

Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform (similar to Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services).

1. To create an Azure account, go to [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) and press **Start Free**.

2. After signing in with your Microsoft account and filling in your personal details, you will be asked to add a credit card.
  - This is only for security purposes (preventing multiple free accounts per person).
  - **You won't be charged** unless you choose to buy a premium account, which we do not need for this course. 

## Set Up Azure Locally on VS Code

1. If you haven't already downloaded the Azure Tools extention, make sure you do that first
2. Follow [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-csharp) to set up your HTTP Trigger Function
