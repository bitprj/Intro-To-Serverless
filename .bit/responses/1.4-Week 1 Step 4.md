# Building our first function ‚ö°[HackerVoice]

> Managing a server is pretty complicated. As a student, mastering serverless functions can help you to build projects that solve real-world problems by integrating APIs, constructing user interfaces, and analysing data without worrying about managing servers.
> 
> [‚ö°Ô∏è 10 Ways to Use Serverless Functions](https://dev.to/aws/10-ways-to-use-serverless-functions-bme)

## ‚úÖ  Tasks:
- [ ] Run `git pull` and create a new branch called `hackervoice` 
- [ ] ***1:*** Create an Azure account 
- [ ] ***2:*** Set up Azure locally on VS Code 
- [ ] ***3:*** Create an HTTP trigger Azure function that gets content from a request parameter called `password` and returns it in the function's body 
- [ ] ***4:*** Test your function locally with Postman and, when you confirm that it works, deploy your function 
- [ ] üöÄ Place your function URL in a [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) called `HACKERVOICE_ENDPOINT` and commit the function's code in a file named `hackervoice/index.js` on the `hackervoice` branch 
- [ ] üöÄ Create a pull request that merges `hackervoice` to `main`, but **do not merge it** 

## üöß Test your Work
**Option 1:**
Paste the *function url* directly in your browser and add the query parameters to the end of the url: `&param_name=param_value`. Your inputted password value should appear.

**Option 2:**
Use **Postman**! Paste the *function url* and make a GET request. In the output box, you should receive the value you put in for the request parameter.

## 1: Create an Azure Account

Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform (similar to Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services).

1. To create an Azure account, go to [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) and press **Start Free**.
2. After signing in with your Microsoft account and filling in your personal details, you will be asked to add a credit card.
  - This is only for security purposes (preventing multiple free accounts per person).
  - **You won't be charged** unless you choose to buy a premium account, which we do not need for this course. 

## Set Up Azure Locally on VS Code

1. Confirm if you have installed the Azure Tools extension on VS Code
2. [Create your local project](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-csharp#create-an-azure-functions-project) 
  * :exclamation: When prompted to set the language, choose **JAVASCRIPT** not C#)
  * ‚ùó When prompted for the Authorization level, **always** choose `Function`
4. [Run the function locally](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-csharp#run-the-function-locally)
5. [Publish the project to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-csharp#publish-the-project-to-azure)
6. Get your function url the Output window in VS Code
7. Test the function on Postman


<details>
<summary>:question: What should running the function look like?</summary>
</br>

Start the debugger by going to index.js and then pressing the F5 key.

<br>

Once you receive the localhost link in the terminal, follow it and notice the terminal log "Executing 'Functions.[Name of your function]'" indicating that you made a request to the function.

<br>

If the request is successfully made in Postman this is what it should look like:

Once you deploy/publish the code to Azure successfully, you will get the function url in the Output of VS Code:

## 3: Create your own HTTP Trigger Function 
*You should see the HTTP Trigger Function template code Microsoft Azure starts you with when you first create your trigger.*
<details>
<summary>:exclamation: What is happening in index.js?</summary>
<br>

- Start of function definition: `module.exports = async function`
- Print comment in Azure Console anytime the function is triggered: `context.log()`
- Get parameter from request body: `const name`
- Conditional (ternary) operator to print message if parameter exists (else print error message):
  ```javascript
  //condition: if name exists
  name
  //? is chosen if the condition evaluates to true
  ? "Hello, " + name + ". This HTTP triggered function executed successfully."
  //: is chosen if the condition evaluates to false
  : "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.";
  ```
- Results of that conditional ternary statement are assigned to `responseMessage` which is returned in the function body

</details>

**Now, let's begin coding by modifying that template.** First, you will need to retrieve content from a request parameter named `password`. Recall that parameters look like this in a full URL:
```
www.mywebsite.com/api/endpoint?param1=hi&param2=hi
```
<details>
<summary>:exclamation: How to get content from a request parameter?</summary>
<br>

Request parameters are a way for an HTTP request to take in information! They are pretty much identical in purpose to why you would want a parameter for a function in a coding language. In this instance, we will need a parameter for the password.
- Request parameters are a property of the `req` or request parameter of the module
- The request has a `query` object that stores all of the parameters passed in
- You don't need to specify what parameters the user needs to input into the HTTP request
- You can acess any parameters that are sent in

You would access a parameter by calling on the query like this:
```javascript
<property name> = req.query.<your property here>;

//example:
let color = req.query.color;
```

If the user makes a request with a parameter of `<url>?color=blue` then the variable color in your function will hold that value.

> Note: your parameter must be named `password`

</details>

Finally, we have to return *something* to the users. In this case, we will be returning the value of the request parameter we just retrieved.
<details>
<summary>:exclamation: How can I return something in the function body?</summary>
<br>

In Azure, `context` is an object that holds data about the response of the HTTP function. Read more about [Accessing the request and response](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-node?tabs=v2#accessing-the-request-and-response).

In our HTTP trigger function, we have defined context object with the body property:

```javascript
context.res = {
        // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
        body: responseMessage
    };
```

To return the password in body, simply replace `responseMessage` with `password`.

</details>

## 4. Test your Function with Postman

1. Deploy your function to Azure
2. Get your function url from the Output window on VS Code(same as before) and make a request on Postman
3. Add a parameter with the key `password` and give it any random value
4. Make sure that your function is returning the `password` parameter in the body

## üöÄ Add Repository Secrets
