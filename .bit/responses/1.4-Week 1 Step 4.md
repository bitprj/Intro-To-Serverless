### Building our first function ⚡[HackerVoice]

### ✅  Tasks:
- [ ] Run `git pull`
- [ ]  Create an Azure account
- [ ]  Create a trigger that gets content from a request parameter called `password`.
- [ ]  Return the content from the request parameter `password` in the body.
- [ ]  Place your function URL in a [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) called `HACKERVOICE_ENDPOINT` so we can check your function.
- [ ]  Commit the function's code in a file named `HackerVoice/index.js` on the `week1` branch!

### 🚧 Test your Work
**Option 1:**
Paste the *function url* directly in your browser and add the query parameters to the end of the url: `&param_name=param_value`. Your inputted password value should appear.

**Option 2:**
Use **Postman**! Paste the *function url* and make a GET request. In the output box, you should get whatever value you put in for the request parameter.

### What are serverless functions?

Managing a server is pretty complicated. As a student, mastering serverless functions can help you to build projects that solve real-world problems by integrating APIs, constructing user interfaces, and analysing data without worrying about managing servers.

### HTTP Trigger Functions

When you create an serverless function, you need to be able to "trigger" the function when you want to use/access it. This allows us to save a lot of money because we only have to run the servers when we need them. An HTTP trigger is one that can be used to invoke a serverless function with an *HTTP Request*.


**What does it mean to *trigger* something?** 🤔 Triggering is the same as "invoking" or calling upon the function. Let's say we have created simple a function that provides us with the current time. We can create a timer trigger that will invoke/call upon that function at some scheduled times in day, for example, every night at 10pm when it's time for bed.

<summary>:exclamation: How do I run my function locally?</summary>
  </br>
Visual Studio Code integrates with Azure Functions Core tools to let you run this project on your local development computer before you publish to Azure.

1. To call your function, press F5 to start the function app project. Output from Core Tools is displayed in the Terminal panel. Your app starts in the Terminal panel. You can see the URL endpoint of your HTTP-triggered function running locally.
![running in command line](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/includes/media/functions-run-function-test-local-vs-code/functions-vscode-f5.png)
If you have trouble running on Windows, make sure that the default terminal for Visual Studio Code isn't set to WSL Bash.
2. With Core Tools running, go to the Azure: Functions area. Under Functions, expand Local Project > Functions. Right-click (Windows) or Ctrl - click (macOS) the HttpExample function and choose Execute Function Now....
![executing function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/includes/media/functions-run-function-test-local-vs-code/execute-function-now.png)
3. In Enter request body you see the request message body value of { "name": "Azure" }. Press Enter to send this request message to your function.

You could have instead sent an HTTP GET request to the http://localhost:7071/api/HttpExample address in a web browser.
4. When the function executes locally and returns a response, a notification is raised in Visual Studio Code. Information about the function execution is shown in Terminal panel.
5. Press Ctrl + C to stop Core Tools and disconnect the debugger.

After you've verified that the function runs correctly on your local computer, it's time to use Visual Studio Code to publish the project directly to Azure.

Let's try triggering this function! Click on the "Get function URL" button and copy the function url, then go ahead and paste it into a new tab. You will be able to see this in the log in your Azure portal, every time your trigger the function.

![trigger the function](https://media.giphy.com/media/gK86LCd5HiEUpz1t0i/giphy.gif)

First let's try to understand what is happening here:

```javascript
module.exports = async function (context, req) {
    context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.');

    const name = (req.query.name || (req.body && req.body.name));
    const responseMessage = name
        ? "Hello, " + name + ". This HTTP triggered function executed successfully."
        : "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.";

    context.res = {
        // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
        body: responseMessage
    };
}
```

The context.log statement at the top of the function is there to indicate to the developer (you) anytime a trigger has been made. Next, we have a constant variable called name that can be passed in through the query parameters (the Input section when you click "Test & Run").

Below this, we have a "conditional ternary operator" which allows us to make a simple conditional statement (if something is true, do this, else/otherwise do that) efficiently.

```javascript

//condition: if name exists
name
//? is chosen if the condition evaluates to true
? "Hello, " + name + ". This HTTP triggered function executed successfully."
//: is chosen if the condition evaluates to false
: "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.";

```

In this case, we have additionally assigned the results of that conditional ternary statement to another variable called `responseMessage` so that we can return the result of the Azure Function using `context.res`.

Once you have made sure that the function is saved, let's try running it again but now with new query parameters. In the variable definition of `name` we enable the function get the value of `name` in two ways. Let's test it out:
1. In the input, create a new Query parameter with the Name "name" and your name for the Value.

<img width="300" alt="query parameters" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28051494/114982357-34754f00-9e44-11eb-95c1-f4fbae1bcb40.png">

2. Run the function and check the HTTP response content - make sure that the output now contains your name.

<img width="300" alt="output" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28051494/114982672-9930a980-9e44-11eb-94f6-fc9d786c7fa5.png">

3. Next, let's try to use the body to change the name. In the input body, change "Azure" to another name (a different name) in double quotes and run the function. You should notice that the output still contains the first name you provided. Check out the code and see if you can figure out why this is.

<details>
<summary>:question: Why does the function output prioritize the Query parameter over the body parameter?</summary>
  </br>
  
```javascript
const name = (req.query.name || (req.body && req.body.name));
```

In the name variable definition you will see that or || operator. This indicates that the value of name can either be `req.query.name` or `req.body && req.body.name`. Because of the order of the options, it will take the first value if the first value exists. Thus, if we want to use the body, we will need to remove the name parameter from the query.
<br><br/>
</details>

4. In the Input, remove the name query parameter and try running the function again.

*One more tip: don’t forget to save! Rewriting code can be challenging and extremely frustrating, so save yourself the trouble!*

## Request Parameters

Request parameters are a way for an HTTP request to take in information! They are pretty much identical in purpose to why you would want a parameter for a function in a coding language. In this instance, we will need a parameter for the password.

### Creating a request parameter
Look at the code for a basic HTTP Function:

```javascript
module.exports = async function (context, req) {
    context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.');

    const name = (req.query.name || (req.body && req.body.name));
    const responseMessage = name
        ? "Hello, " + name + ". This HTTP triggered function executed successfully."
        : "This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.";

    context.res = {
        // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
        body: responseMessage
    };
}
```
Request parameters are a property of the `req` or request parameter of the module. The request has a `query` object that stores all of the parameters passed in. You don't need to specify what parameters the user needs to input into the HTTP request, but can acess any parameters that are sent in. You would access a parameter by calling on the query like this:
```javascript
<property name> = req.query.<your property here>;
```
for instance, if you were looking for a color parameter, you can access it with the following code
```javascript
color = req.query.color;
```
> Note: your parameter must be named `password`
