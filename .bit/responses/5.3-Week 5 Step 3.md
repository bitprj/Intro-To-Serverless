## Laying out the groundwork

### ‚úÖ  Task:

- [ ]  In a new [figma](figma.com) file named "Serverless Camp Project" create a flowchart showing the flow of information and components involved in your project including any Azure Functions and APIs you plan on using
- [ ]  Create a branch named `week5`
- [ ]  Upload the flowchart into a new folder called "project" (where you will be saving all of your project related files) and commit your changes to move on

### How do I create a flowchart?

**Part C: Review**
1. Get a friend/mentor to look over the flowchart and try to explain back the program to you
2. Consider if there are any holes in their explanation that you still need to visualize in the flowchart for it to make more sense
