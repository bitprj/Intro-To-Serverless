## Documentation

### ✅  Task:

- [ ] Document your first component in blog.md
- [ ] 🚀 Commit your changes to the `final-project` branch, make a pull request, and merge it

Once you have successfully completed developing your first component, you can start documenting your project blog. Remember that the purpose of this blog is to help someone else create your project from scratch, so as you start writing, you will need to break down your code as much as possible and explain it so that someone else can learn from your example.

> Check out the [Save Money and Frustration on Amazon using Azure Functions](https://bitproject.org/blog/serverless-price-scraper) blog to see how Fifi broke down her project into multiple steps.

> Check out the [Creating a File Sharing and Conversion Web App with Azure Functions](https://bitproject.org/blog/serverless-bunnimage) blog to see how Emily breaks down her code into smaller chunks to document, describes how it works, and pastes the code at the bottom.

### Quick tips

* If your project required any kind of groundwork like installing npm packages or setting up Azure locally, document this first in "Step 0"
* Break down your code:
  * Copy all of your code and paste it into a code snippet in your blog
  * Break it down into multiple snippets in order of how you wrote the code
  * Before each snippet, write a description of what the code is for and how it works
  * Define keywords that were new to you or would be to your audience
  * Tip: use substeps to make your blog easier to follow

If you have completed multiple components of your project this week, document them as you go.

### Documentation Best Practices:

Documentation is easier than it seems! Here are some tips to consider when you begin:
1. Write for your audience. In this case, you're writing an educational blog meant to ***educate*** students who have little-no coding experience. Consider where you were at when you started this curriculum and make sure someone at that same level would be able to make sense of your blog.
2. Talk directly to your audience (as we are here) and help guide them over the course of your blog to develop this really cool project.
3. If there are concepts/terms that seem complicated, try your best to explain them in a way that would make sense to you.
4. Be intentional about what you choose to explain. Some technical concepts require understanding other concepts as well, but you don't want your blog to become a dictionary. Choose the concepts that matter to your project the most, and add external links to documentations/websites for those that you don't want to get into but would be valuable for your audience to understand.
5. Make it fun to read! Think about how Buzzfeed articles are organized into steps and have a lot of gifs/emojis/images/other visuals to help engage the audience.
