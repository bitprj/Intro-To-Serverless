## Create the CataaS Website ~ meow

#### Demo: [🐱](https://week4step5.emilychen10.repl.co/)
*Create a website that return a picture from the CatAAS API with the name of the cat being the input (each click should call the Cataas API)*

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69332964/121592136-4caeb800-ca08-11eb-8c34-1718db133049.png" width="300" height="300" />
</p>

### ✅  Task:
- [ ] ***1:*** Create a new `twocatz-frontend` branch
- [ ] ***2:*** Create an form page in a new HTML file called `catzapp/index.html`  with a text input (`type="text"`) and a button (`type="button"`) that calls the Javascript function `y1k3s()` in `twocatz/index.js` 
- [ ] ***3:*** Create a `img` object with id `image` in `catzapp/index.html`
- [ ] ***4:*** Write the `y1k3s()` function that replaces the `img` div with a picture from the [CataaS API](http://cataas.com/) containing input from the text box
- [ ] ***5:*** Commit your changes to `catzapp/index.html` and `catzapp/script.js` to the `twocatz-frontend` branch
- [ ] ***6:*** Create a pull request that merges `twocatz-frontend` to `main`, and only merge the pull request when the bot approves your changes! 


> 💡 **Tip:** It's a good idea to name your tags with `id`, since you'll then be able to use `document.getElementById` for modifying and getting values.

> 🚨 **NOTE:** The CounselorBot will be checking the code to see if you use the [CataaS API](http://cataas.com/) endpoint. However, if the API is down, you may use the [substitute version](https://bit-cat.azurewebsites.net/cat/says/serverless) for testing purposes. Make sure to change it back when you submit your code!

### 🚧 Test your Work
Open up your LiveServer plugin and start your local server. **To test your web app:**

⚠️ When you enter "catzrule" into the textbox and click the button, is there a picture that appears with a cat and "catzrule" on it?

## 1: Creating an HTML template
In Visual Studio Code, you can create a html template containing the basic header tags by typing `!` + `Tab`. This will create something like: 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```
> Everything that appers on the page will be in the `<body>` tags, and this is where you will be adding most (if not all of your html code.

## 2: Getting the Cat Pic
The `img` tag embeds an image, and [it has attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp). We'll be using `src`.

<details>
<summary>:question: How can I modify src to get the picture?</summary>
  </br>

When the button is clicked, it will call `y1k3s()`, so we will add a line of code in the function.
In HTML, the img tag looks like this:
```html
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600">
```
We can change the `src` value to a URL, or a file on a server. In our case, we'll change it to a URL to the Cat API.
> 💡 Recall that the endpoint is https://cataas.com/cat/says/[your_text]

```js
 document.getElementById("YOUR_IMAGE_ID").src = THE_ENDPOINT + THE_INPUT
 ```
