## Code!

### ✅  Task:

- [ ] Based on your schedule, beging your first task
- [ ] 

### Developing the first component

Let's look back at the advice we got from the previous step: "start small then build big." Your goal is to get something working - not to developing your final project in 1 week.
* Begin by just having one working component of the project. Ex:
  * Press a button on your webpage and receive information
  * Create a working Azure Function that can return information
* After that's complete and tested, begin building onto that with more and more features!
