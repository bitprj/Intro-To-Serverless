Install <a href='https://desktop.github.com/'>Github Desktop</a> and commit from your local computer. We'll go over code editors next if you don't have one to work on your code locally. You can also use <a href='http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/first_time.html'>git on your commandline</a>.

  <summary><b>:question: How can I make a branch?</b></summary>
  
  Before you continue, we'd recommend going over the [Intro to GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) if you're unfamiliar with branches.
  
  On the GitHub web editor, you can follow these steps to create a branch:
  1. Click on "Code" at the top left of this page
  2. Click on the gray button that says "main" or "master"
  3. Type in the name of your new branch, and if it doesn't already exist, you will get an option to create a new branch
  4. Always make sure that you are in the correct branching before making any edits

**Pull Request Guidelines**
* Name the Pull Request `Adding self introduction`
* In the description, place a sentence describing what the Pull Request contributes to the main branch.

Key functions you should be familiar with after this task include:
- Committing changes
- Forking a repository
- Making a new branch
- Making a pull request
