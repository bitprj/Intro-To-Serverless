## Getting Emotional ~ Returning the Dominant Emotion

### ‚úÖ Task:
**Modify your Azure Function so that it returns the Dominant Emotion of an Image.**
- [ ] 1. In your function `emotionalgifs`, determine the dominant emotion in the emotion data and output the dominant emotion in the request body when you make a `POST` request
- [ ] üöÄ Commit your code to `emotionalgifs/index.js` on the `emotionalgifs` branch

## 1. Finding the Dominant Emotion
In order to match the results of the Face API with Gifs from the **Giphy API**, we need to determine the dominant emotion from the API response.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Modifying the Azure Function
We need to access the emotion data **by itself**, without the face id and other analyzed data. To do this, we need to create **another variable** in the first async function in our Azure Function:

```js
let emotions = result[0].faceAttributes.emotion;
```
:bulb: Now you've got the JSON object with all the emotion values, find the highest valued emotion! **Use `context.log(emotions)` to see how it's structured.**
> We're accessing the data at index 0 because we're analyzing **one face**. If there were two faces, the data for the second face would be stored at index 1.

<summary>‚ùì How do I find the max value from the JSON object?</summary>
 </br>

1Ô∏è‚É£ We need to create **an array** with the emotion values (ranging from 0 to 1) so that we can manipulate it and find the dominant emotion. `Object.values()` converts an object into an array, with each **value** in the object stored as a separate element:

```js
let objects = Object.values(WHAT_IS_YOUR_JSON);
// FILL IT IN
// What your array could look like: [0.01, 0.34, .....]
```

> :bulb: In JSON, the **key** values are what you use to access the **value**. `{key: value}`, or in our case, `{emotion: value}`.
Finally, we need to find the dominant emotion in the array `objects`:

2Ô∏è‚É£ Let's break this line down.
```js
const main_emotion = Object.keys(emotions).find(key => emotions[key] === Math.max(...objects));
```
- `Math.max(...objects)` finds the max value. Let's say it's `0.99`.
- `Object.keys(emotions).find(key => emotions[key] === Math.max(...objects));` finds the emotion, or key, that matches the max value of `0.99`. Let's say it's `happiness`.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Now, `main_emotion` contains the dominant emotion! All we need to do is output `main_emotion` when the function is called:

```js
context.res = {
        // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
        body: main_emotion
};
```
