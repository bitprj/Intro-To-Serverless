*This week, you will be going through steps to set up tools needed to be successful in this camp. If you are already familiar with some, feel free to skip to the end and complete the task to move on.*

### GitHub

<details>
<summary><b>:question: What is Github?</b></summary>
</br>
GitHub is a cloud-based repository hosting service that is widely used in the tech industry. It allows teams to use Git for version control, collaboration, and file management. <b>It's a version-control system for tracking changes, managing state, and teams concurrently developing on the same files or directories.</b> Git and Github's tools are specifically designed to make coordinating work easier, and they are one of the most popular tools among students and the industry.

<summary>:exclamation: Help! I don't know how to use it and I need more information.</summary>
  </br>
  If you want to learn more about <b>what it is</b> and <b>how to use it,</b> try taking <a href='https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github'>this</a> GitHub Learning Lab Course. After finishing it, you will have a strong understanding of all the features GitHub has to offer.

**One very important rule...**
*Don't* work on your code in the web editor. This is bad practice, and you will regret it later.
<details>
<summary>:question: What should I do instead?</summary>
  </br>
Install <a href='https://desktop.github.com/'>Github Desktop</a> and commit from your local computer. We'll go over code editors next if you don't have one to work on your code locally. You can also use <a href='http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/first_time.html'>git on your commandline</a>.
