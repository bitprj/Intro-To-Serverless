## Making `fetch` Happen
We are going to how use the form to call our Azure Function! Yay :tada:! Things are coming together.

### ‚úÖ  Task:
- [ ] Modify `useImage()` function with `await fetch` to send the form input to your Bunnimage Azure Function
- [ ] If the upload was successful, change the `output` div to `Your image has been stored successfully!`
- [ ] Commit your updated code to `bunnimage/script.js`

### üöß Test your Work
Open up your LiveServer plugin and start your local server. **To test your web app:**

:one: Upload an image and click submit. *Do you get a "Your image has been stored successfully!" message?*

:two: Log into your Azure portal and navigate to your storage account. *In your container, do you see your image?*

## How do I call the Azure Function?

The Fetch API is built in to Javascript to make HTTP requests (using GET, POST and other methods), download, and upload files.

To start a request, call the special function `fetch()`:

```javascript 
const response = await fetch(resource, options);
```

`Fetch` accepts two arguments:
- `resource`: the URL string, or a Request object
- `options`: the configuration object with properties like method, headers, body, credentials, and more.

<details>
<summary>:question: What does fetch exactly do?</summary>
  </br>

`fetch()` starts a request and returns a promise. When the request completes, the promise is resolved with the Response object. **If the request fails due to some network problems, the promise is rejected.**
> Keep this in mind if your function throws a promise error!
  <br><br/>
</details>

## How to configure "options"
In order to pass the type of method, the payload in the pody, and headers, you have to configure the "options" part of the fetch function. 

```diff 
const response = await fetch(resource, {
+   method: ... ,
+   body: ... , 
+   headers: { ... }
});
```

Fill in the method, headers and body with the correct information compatible with your API!

## How to validate that the upload worked!
We need to let the users know if the upload was successful! We do this by checking the response from our API!
