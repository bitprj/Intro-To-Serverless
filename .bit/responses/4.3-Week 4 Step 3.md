## Making `fetch` Happen
#### Demo: [🐰](https://week4step3.emilychen10.repl.co)
*We are going to how use the form to call our Azure Function! Yay :tada:! Things are coming together.*

### ✅  Task:
- [ ] Modify `useImage()` function with `await fetch` to send the form input to your Bunnimage Azure Function
- [ ] If the upload was successful, change the `output` div to `Your image has been stored successfully!`
- [ ] Modify your CORS settings in your function app so your frontend can make requests.
- [ ] Commit your updated code to `bunnimage/script.js` to the `bunnimage-frontend` branch

### 🚧 Test your Work
Open up your LiveServer plugin and start your local server. **To test your web app:**

:one: Upload an image and click submit. *Do you get a "Your image has been stored successfully!" message?*

:two: Log into your Azure portal and navigate to your storage account. *In your container, do you see your image?*

## How do I call the Azure Function?

The [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) is built in to Javascript to make HTTP requests (using GET, POST and other methods), download, and upload files.

> :bulb: We **don't** have to install `node-fetch` as an npm package since `fetch` is built into JavaScript. Remember: we were using NodeJS before.

To start a request, call the special function `fetch()`:

```javascript 
const response = await fetch(resource, options);
```

`Fetch` accepts two arguments:
- `resource`: the URL string, or a Request object
- `options`: the configuration object with properties like method, headers, body, credentials, and more.

<details>
<summary>:question: What does fetch exactly do?</summary>
  </br>

`fetch()` starts a request and returns a promise. When the request completes, the promise is resolved with the Response object. **If the request fails due to some network problems, the promise is rejected.**
> Keep this in mind if your function throws a promise error!
  <br><br/>
</details>

## How to configure "options"
In order to pass the type of method, the payload in the pody, and headers, you have to configure the "options" part of the fetch function. 

```diff 
const response = await fetch(resource, {
+   method: ... ,
+   body: ... , 
+   headers: { ... }
});
```

Fill in the method, headers and body with the correct information compatible with your API!
> :bulb: Refer back to previous Fetch requests we made in NodeJS for hints. Remember for this request, we **are not** receiving JSON!

## How to validate that the upload worked
We need to let the users know if the upload was successful! We do this by making sure we receive a response from our upload API:

<details>
<summary>❗ Use a "try...catch"</summary>
  </br>

A [`try...catch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch) is what it sounds like - it catches errors. This makes for a better user experience and is crucial to error handling.
```js
try { 
    // Try receiving data from your fetch request
    // Change the output div's value
} catch (e) {
    // If an error occurred, tell the user!
}
```
  <br><br/>
</details>

## Update CORS Settings

CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing) settings tells the Function App what domains can make requests to the Azure Functions.

<details><summary>:exclamation: How can I change it?</summary>
  </br>

Head to your function app in your portal and find the button on the left hand side called `CORS`.

  <br><br/>
</details>

<details><summary>:question: What should I change it to?</summary>
  </br>
  
Change it to a wildcard operator (`*`), which allows *all* origin domains to make requests.
> :bulb: Be sure to remove any other existing inputs before attempting to save with wildcard. **Don't forget to save your changes!**
