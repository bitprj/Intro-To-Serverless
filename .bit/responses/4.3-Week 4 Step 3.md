## Week 4 Step 3

### Connecting the JS and HTML

In this step, you're going to **connect** the **HTML and JS** you wrote in the last two steps!

## **:pencil: Task 3: Connect the JS and HTML so that when the user presses _submit_, the JS is run.** <br>

</br>

1. In your `.html` file, find the **form tag**.
2. When the form is submitted, make the **async function** run.
</br>

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I make the async function run in the form?</summary>
  </br>

Add `onsubmit=` to your form, after the form's **id** is declared.

Your form should look like this (with input tags inside, of course):

```html

<form id="unique_id_here" onsubmit=>

</form>

```

Now, in the **onsubmit property**, call your **async function** as if you were writing js.

In the end, your form should look something like this (again, the input tags should be inside):

```html

<form id="unique_id_here" onsubmit=functionName(parameter)>

</form>

```

  <br>
</details>

Now, we're going to make connect the **second Azure function** to Azure's **Cosmos DB**!
