## How do I call the Azure Function?

The Fetch API is built in to Javascript to make HTTP requests (using GET, POST and other methods), download, and upload files.

To start a request, call the special function `fetch()`:

```javascript 
const response = await fetch(resource, options);
```

which accepts 2 arguments:
- resource: the URL string, or a Request object
- options: the configuration object with properties like method, headers, body, credentials, and more.

`fetch()` starts a request and returns a promise. When the request completes, the promise is resolved with the Response object. If the request fails due to some network problems, the promise is rejected.
