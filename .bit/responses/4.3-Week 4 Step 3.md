## Week 4 Step 3

### Submitting the Final Project

Once your MVP has been completed, it's time to finish the final project! 

In addition to the project, **write a blog tutorial** that describes step-by-step how a beginner could go around recreating your project.

The outline of your blog tutorial should look like the following:

1. **Abstract:** A 200-250 word description of your project including why you made this project, what problem it solves, what your solution is, and what impact it has on the world.
2. **Image** of yourself working on the project (candid or posed, as high quality as possible)
3. **Profile Picture** (also as high quality as possible)
4. **Tag line:** An IMPACTFUL description of your project (with a maximum of one sentence)
5. **Step-by-step blog**
    - **Beginning:** why you made this project, what problem it solves
    - **Middle:** clear instructions on how to make this project from scratch, split code up into small parts and explain each part concisely but precisely
    - **End:** what impact does this project have, what would you like to do to improve it, how you feel about this project, etc.
    - **Tip:** use simple language and a lot of visuals, make it easy to read and follow

To write your blog tutorial, it might be a good idea to use a markdown editor like [Typora](https://typora.io/).

**To move on, commit your final project WITH a markdown file of your blog tutorial. Comment any changes you made to your final project in comparison to your project proposal!**
