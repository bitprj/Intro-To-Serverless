## Downloading your image!

Write and connect a JS file to make a GET request to the download Azure function that includes the codename to receive the link.

Edit the button on the HTML page so that it downloads the file when clicked. 

### ✅  Task:
- [ ] Make sure you're on the `week4` branch
- [ ] Create a new input field called `downloadusername` and create a button that calls the function `downloadImage()` in `index.html` 
- [ ] Create the `downloadImage()` function with a `await fetch` GET request to send `downloadusername` to your Bunnimage Azure Function to return the file download uri
- [ ] If the fetch was successful, open the file download link using [`window.open()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open)
- [ ] Commit your updated code to `bunnimage/index.html` and `bunnimage/script.js`
