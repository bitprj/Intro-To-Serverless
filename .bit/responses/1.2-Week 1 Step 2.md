## Week 1 Step 2

### Getting Started
## Downloading an IDE

*This week, you will be going through steps to set up tools needed to be successful in this camp. If you are already familiar with some, feel free to skip to the end and complete the task to move on.*

### Visual Studio Code

<details>
<summary>:question: What is an IDE and why do we need it?</summary>
</br>
Before we start coding, we need to install an IDE. An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Although there are hundreds of IDEs to choose from, we are going to use Visual Studio Code due to its popularity and integration with Azure (via extensions and libraries).

    </br>

To install VSC, go to: https://code.visualstudio.com/download and choose your operating system (ie. Windows, Mac, Linux, etc). Then click **Download** and run the installer (usually a `.exe` or `.zip` file). After it's installed, open it up and try it out. If you need some help navigating VSC, check out this super helpful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqCgcpAypFQ">YouTube</a> video.

## **:pencil: Task 2: Code and export a JavaScript function named `hello` that returns "`Hello World`" in a file named `helloworld.js`. Commit the file to the root directory of a new branch called `week1`.**

<details>
<summary>:exclamation: Why and how do I export a function?</summary>
</br>

JavaScript enables the ability to [export functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export) in a program so that you can access them in other parts of the program via the import statement. In this case, we want to export your programs in order to run them across the testing code.

Let's say your function name is `hello`. To export it, add this line of code at the very bottom of your file outside of your function: `module.exports = hello`.

Example:

```js
function hello() {
    // your code
} 

module.exports = hello
```

When you commit the file, we will try to run the function by importing it and compare it's output to the expected output like so:

```js
let hello = require('../../helloworld.js')
let output = hello()
```

#### How does this apply to code in the real world?
Just like you can import code from modules other people have written, you can also **import functions you wrote from *other files* to reuse them.** In function oriented programming, you use functions over and over again to save code. If you want to use the function `hello()` in another file, you would need to import it.

<summary>:exclamation: Can I have more detailed steps?</summary>
    </br>

1. Create a new file
2. Name the file helloworld.js
3. Write your code
4. If you have node installed on your computer, open terminal on VS Code and type 'node helloworld.js'
5. If you have not installed node on your computer, you will need to do that first: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
6. Tip: to test your function, call it in your code.
7. Create a new branch named `week1` and commit your `helloworld.js` file in the root directory.

## **:camping: Make sure you export the function, and commit `helloworld.js` to the root directory of a new branch `week1` in this repository to move on!**

*Note: From now on, you will never need to close an issue. The Counselor will do that for you, create new issues, and new comments for further instructions!*
