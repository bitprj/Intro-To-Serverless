## Jamming with an IDE
*This week, you will be going through steps to set up tools needed to be successful in this camp. If you are already familiar with some, feel free to skip to the end and complete the task to move on.*

### ✅  Task:

- [ ]  Create a new branch named `week1`
- [ ]  Create a file `week1/helloworld.js` 
- [ ]  In `helloworld.js`, Write and Export a JS function `hello` that returns "Hello World"
- [ ] Commit your changes to move on 
 
### 🚧 Test your Work
If you run `node helloworld.js` in the terminal, the output should be `Hello World`

*Note: From now on, you will never need to close an issue. The Counselor will do that for you, create new issues, and new comments for further instructions!*

### The IDE - Visual Studio Code
Before we start coding, we need to install an IDE. An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Although there are hundreds of IDEs to choose from, we are going to use Visual Studio Code due to its popularity and integration with Azure (via extensions and libraries).

  </br>
  
To install VSC, go to: https://code.visualstudio.com/download and choose your operating system (ie. Windows, Mac, Linux, etc). Then click **Download** and run the installer (usually a `.exe` or `.zip` file). After it's installed, open it up and try it out. If you need some help navigating VSC, check out this super helpful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqCgcpAypFQ">YouTube</a> video.

Inside VSCode, you downloaded four extensions: **Azure Account, Azure App Service, Azure Functions, and Live Server.** All of the Azure extensions allow you to work on your Azure Function App in VS code instead of working directly through the Microsoft portal. Live Server is a quick and temporary testing server, and you can use it to test HTML pages. To launch, right click on your html file and press "Open with Live Server" or click "Go Live" in the bottom right corner:

  <summary>:exclamation: How do I use GitHub on VS Code?</summary>
  
  1. Check out this awesome documentation about [how to set up Git on your local computer](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git) 
  2. Once you have complete the steps in the documentation, clone this repo on your computer 
  3. Use the following commands to work with branches in the terminal:
  - Check which branch you're in: `git branch` 
  - Create a new branch and change into it: `git checkout --b name-of-branch` 
  - Change branch: `git checkout name-of-branch`

*Make sure to use Dark Theme unless you want to live life on the edge...*

:exclamation: *Don't forget to `git pull` before making any changes to your local repo!!*

### Writing and Exporting a Javascript function
JavaScript enables the ability to [export functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export) in a program so that you can access them in other parts of the program via the import statement. In this case, we want to export your programs in order to run them across the testing code.

<details>
<summary>:exclamation: How do I export a function?</summary>
</br>
Let's say your function name is `hello`. To export it, add this line of code at the very bottom of your file outside of your function: `module.exports = hello`.

Example:

```js
function hello() {
    // your code
} 

module.exports = hello
```

When you commit the file, we will try to run the function by importing it and compare it's output to the expected output like so:

```js
let hello = require('../../helloworld.js')
let output = hello()
```

#### How does this apply to code in the real world?
Just like you can import code from modules other people have written, you can also **import functions you wrote from *other files* to reuse them.** In function oriented programming, you use functions over and over again to save code. If you want to use the function `hello()` in another file, you would need to import it.

<summary>:exclamation: Can I have more detailed steps?</summary>
    </br>

1. Create a new file
2. Name the file helloworld.js
3. Write your code
4. If you have node installed on your computer, open terminal on VS Code and type 'node helloworld.js'
5. If you have not installed node on your computer, you will need to do that first: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
6. Tip: to test your function, call it in your code.
7. Create a new branch named `week1` and commit your `helloworld.js` file in the root directory.
