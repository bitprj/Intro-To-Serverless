# Good luck! :wave:

We'll still be around, but just keep following these basic steps until you reach the final version of your final project:

- [ ] Continue working in the `final-project` branch
- [ ] Following what we did last week, select the next issue you want to work on and develop your project
- [ ] Document the project in `blog.md`
- [ ] Close the issue when you are satisfied with your updates
- [ ] ðŸš€ Commit any changes to the `final-project` branch, make a pull request, and merge it
