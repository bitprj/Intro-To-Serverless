# Exposed!!

## ✅  Task:
Modify the `deepsecrets` Azure Function to 
- [ ]  1. Query for all secrets stored in the CosmosDB
- [ ]  2. Select a random secret to return in the body
- [ ] 🚀 Commit your updated function code to `deepsecrets/index.js`to the `deepsecrets` branch

❗ Make sure to **return your message** in this format:
```
Thanks 😊! Stored your secret "insert_user's_message". 😯 Someone confessed that: "a_random_secret"
```

## 🚧 Test Your Work

To test your work, send your Twilio number a text message. You should still receive a text back that contains a message similar to the one below, but now the second secret returned will be random, and no longer the most recent secret stored!

```
Thanks 😊! Stored your secret "insert_user's_message". 😯 Someone confessed that: "a_random_secret"
```

> 💡 Yay! This means you've successfully queried for and returned a random secret.

## 1. Modifying the SQL Query

In your `createDocument` function, you'll first want to modify the original SQL query to now query for *all* secrets inside your container.

```js
const querySpec = {
    query: "SELECT * from c"
};
```
</details>

## 2. Selecting a Random Item

Next, you'll want to select a random secret by:

1. Generating a random **integer** that is *strictly less* than the length of the array of secrets. (Hint: use `Math.floor()` and `Math.random()`)
2. Returning the secret at an index of this random number.

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I generate a random number for the index?</summary>

The `Math.floor()` function returns the [floor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/floor) of the given number - ie. the largest integer less than or equal to a given number. In the example below, the generated random number will never be greater than `items.length`.

```js
var random_value = Math.floor(items.length * Math.random());
```
</details>

:bulb: Make sure to change your responseMessage to return the correct index of `items`.
