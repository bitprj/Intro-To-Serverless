## Error Handling ~ Sir this is a Wendy's
Ideally, users will fill the web form with the correct information. However, people make mistakes. In this step, we will be implementing some form validation to make sure that a user has inputted text value before submitting their password. 

### ‚úÖ  Task:
- [ ]  Check you are on the `week4` branch 
- [ ] Change your HTML form to accept `multipart/form-data` in `index.html`
- [ ] Add a file input to `index.html` that accepts `image/x-png,image/jpeg` 
- [ ]  Modify the  `getImage` event handler function in `index.js` to create an alert if either the file input or the `name` input is null
- [ ] Commit your updated code to `bunnimage/index.html` and `bunnimage/script.js`

### üöß Test your Work
Open up your LiveServer plugin and start your server.

<details>
<summary>:pencil: **You have three test cases to try:**</summary>
  </br>

1. **The "correct" way**: Submit both a file and text. Check that you receive "Thanks!"
2. **The "unexpected" way (file)**: Submit a file that is not png or jpeg. Does it work?
3. **The "unexpected" way (text input)**: Try submitting without entering a username. You should get an alert box that says "No name error."

## Accepting Images as an Input
In HTML Forms, the `enctype` attribute specifies how the form-data should be encoded when submitting it to the server. Like we learned before, if we want to upload files, we need send form-data encoded as `multipart/form-data`

```diff
    <h1>Bunnimage</h1>
+    <form onsubmit="getImage(event)" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <label>Code: </label>
```

To add the image upload input, add an additional file input within the form

```diff 
<form onsubmit="getImage(event)" enctype="multipart/form-data">
+   <input type="file" name="image"></input>
    <input id="name" type="text"  placeholder="Enter your file's name">
```

## Input Validation?
We need to validate two things. 

- [ ] the image is either in the .png or .jpeg format
- [ ] the name of the image is non-null

The HTML `<input>` accept Attribute specifies a filter for what file types the user can pick from the file input dialog box. The accept attribute can only be used with <input type="file">.

```diff 
<form onsubmit="getImage(event)" enctype="multipart/form-data">
+   <input type="file"  accept="image/x-png,image/jpeg" name="image"></input>
    <input id="name" type="text"  placeholder="Enter your file's name">
```
To validate that the name isn't null, check if `document.getElementById("username").value` isn't empty, to change the `output` div to "Thanks!", or display an `alert("No name error.")`
