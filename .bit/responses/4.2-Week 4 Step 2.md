## Week 4 Step 2

### Writing the js

In this step, you're going to write the **js** that will call your **second HTTP Trigger function**!

## **:pencil: Task 2: Write the js and connect it to the HTTP Trigger Function.** <br>

</br>

1. In the `.js` file you created last week, use ADD

</br>

<details>
<summary>:question: I'm not exactly sure how to create the submission form.</summary>
  </br>

The form should look something like this:

```html

<form id="FILL_THIS_IN">

  <input type="text" name="phone" id="FILL_THIS_IN" accept="10" placeholder="FILL_THIS_IN">
  <input type="submit" value="FILL_THIS_IN" id="UNIQUE_ID_HERE"></input>

</form>

```

The first `<input>` tag creates a text input box (see `type="text"`?) where the user can enter their phone number.

The second `<input>` tag creates a submission button that, when clicked, makes the `.js` code (which we will create in a later step) run. This code will call the 2nd HTTP Trigger function you coded last week!

  <br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I source the .js file?</summary>
  </br>

The sourcing should look like this:

```html

<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="../../assets/js/vendor/jquery.min.js"><\/script>')</script>
<script src="ENTER_JS_FILE_NAME" type="text/javascript"></script>

```

Now, once we complete the `.js` file, you will be able to connect your `html` and `js` code!

  <br>
</details>

Now, we need to work on the `.js` file and connect the two!

## **:camping: To move on, create and merge a pull request with your new code in `index.js` into the branch `week4`!**

_Remember to give each element a **unique** id!_
