## Error Handling ~ Sir this is a Wendy's
Ideally, users will fill the web form with the correct information. However, people make mistakes. In this step, we will be implementing some form validation to make sure that a user has inputted text value before submitting their password. 

### ✅  Task:
- [ ]  Check you are on the `week4` branch 
- [ ] Change your HTML form to accept `multipart/form-data` in `index.html`
- [ ] Add a file input to `index.html` that accepts `image/x-png,image/jpeg` 
- [ ]  Modify the  `getImage` event handler function in `index.js` to create an alert if either the file input or the `name` input is null
- [ ] Commit your code to `bunnimage/index.js` and `bunnimage/index.html`
