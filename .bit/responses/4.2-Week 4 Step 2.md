## Week 4 Step 2

### Writing the JS

In this step, you're going to write the **js** that will call your **second HTTP Trigger function**!

## **:pencil: Task 2: Write the js and connect it to the HTTP Trigger Function.** <br>

</br>

1. In the `.js` file you created last week, create an **async function** with a parameter.
2. Remember to use **prevent default**, or else the entire project will not work!
3. Save the values from the **input html tags** (from _Week 4, Step 1_) in variables.
4. Declare a variable using the **await** keyword.
5. Open the code of your HTTP trigger in the **portal**. Find the button that says **Get Function URL** and click it.
6. Copy your function link.
7. Go back to your `.js` file and the new variable. With the function url to call the Azure function.
8. Make sure your HTTP request is **POST request** and _**not**_ a **GET request**!

<summary>:question: How do I use the function URL to call the HTTP trigger?</summary>
  </br>

Your function URL should be formatted like the following example:

`https://function-name.azurewebsites.net/api/trigger-name`

  <br>

<summary>:question: How do I source the .js file?</summary>
  </br>

The sourcing should look like this:

```html

<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="../../assets/js/vendor/jquery.min.js"><\/script>')</script>
<script src="ENTER_JS_FILE_NAME" type="text/javascript"></script>

```

Now, once we complete the `.js` file, you will be able to connect your `html` and `js` code!

  <br>
</details>

Now, we need to work on the `.js` file and connect the two!

## **:camping: To move on, create and merge a pull request with your new code in `index.js` into the branch `week4`!**

_Remember to give each element a **unique** id!_
