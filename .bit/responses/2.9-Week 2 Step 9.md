## Week 2 Step 9
### Calling the Twillio API
Now that your account and coding environments are set up, it is time to get to work! As a reminder, you are using the Twilio API to send Face API data as a text message. Connect your Twilio profile to your local environment then send a message by calling the API. Your message should describe the emotion on an inputted image based on Face API results, such as "the person in your inputted image is sad".

> Hint: all of this can be done programmatically!

### 📝 Task 9: Call the Twilio API
<details>
<summary>❓ Where do I begin?</summary>
</br>

In your function but outside of the module, declare 3 constants: one for your account SID, another for your auth token, and the last for the twilio client.
</br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>❓ Where do I find the auth token and account SID?</summary>
</br>

The auth token and account SIDs are found on your [Twilio dashboard](https://www.twilio.com/) console.
</br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>❓ How do I import Twilio?</summary>
</br>

Check you that you have installed Twilio through npm by typing `twilio --version` in your terminal. Afterwards, instantiate the `client` constant you declared to require the Twilio package. Pass in the account SID and auth token as parameters.
</details>

<details>
<summary>❓ What function do I call?</summary>
</br>

Look at the functions your client can perform. If you are stuck, you can refer to the Twilio API at https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms.
</br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>❓ What parameters do I need in my Twilio API call?</summary>
</br>

Make sure to at least have a `body` (the message you are sending) and the `from` (your twilio phone number) in the function. 
</br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>❓ Need help navigating JSON?</summary>
</br>

You already have all the code to obtain this information, along with some other pieces of data. To isolate the emotion, look at the format of the returned information and pick out what you need. For additional help, use [this resource](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10368171/how-to-extract-a-json-object-thats-inside-a-json-object)!

### :camping: To move on, create and merge a PR with your working Azure function's updated files.
> Note: Make sure to instantiate constants handling your account information **environment variables** rather than the actual values. You can do this using `process.env`.
