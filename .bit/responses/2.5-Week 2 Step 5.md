## Week 2 Step 5

### Call the Face API P2: Using Fetch

![fetchapi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69332964/103604217-6e969280-4ede-11eb-8843-2df2bccae8fa.png)

*What is happening in this flowchart?*

There are many ways to make a POST request, but to stay consistent, we're going to use the package  `node-fetch`. This package makes HTTP requests in a similar format as what we're going to use for the rest of the project.


### Concepts to know:
* GET and POST requests
* Context
* Await and Promises
* Arrays (`parts[0]`)
* Headers
* [Javascript Object Properties](https://www.sitepoint.com/back-to-basics-javascript-object-syntax/#:~:text=Accessing%20Properties,followed%20by%20the%20property%20name.)

### 📝 Task 5: Use Fetch in order to send a post request to the Face API Endpoint and receive emotion data

<summary>❓ Where do I begin?</summary>
</br>

**Install the package using the same format we did for `parse-multipart`.**

```js
//install the node-fetch pacakge
var fetch = '<CODE HERE>'
```
When you've finished installing, read through the [**API** section](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch#api) of the documentation. We're going to make a call using the `fetch(url, {options})` function.

<summary>❓How do I use Fetch?</summary>
</br>

We're calling the `fetch` function - notice the **await** keyword, which we need because `fetch` returns a **Promise**, which is a proxy for a value that isn't currently known. You can read about Javascript promises [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). 

Javascript is what we call a "synchronous" language, meaning operations in Javascript block other operations from executing until they are complete, creating a sense of single directional flow. This means that only one operation can happen at a time. However, in order to maximize efficiency (save time and resources), Javascript allows the use of asynchronous functions.
<br>
</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary>❓ What is an async function?</summary>
</br>

Simply put, async functions allow other operations to continue running as they are being executed. Refer to [this site](https://dev.to/hardy613/asynchronous-vs-synchronous-programming-23ed) for more information.

Promises are sychnronous objects, similar to their real life meaning, return a value at some point in the future, or a reason for why that value could not be returned - they represent the result of an async function that may or may not be resolved.

<summary>❓ What is the URL?</summary>
</br>

Notice that the URL is just the uriBase with the params we specified earlier appended on.

For now, fill in the `method`  and `body`.  

```js
async function analyzeImage(img){
    
    const subscriptionKey = '<YOUR SUBSCRIPTION KEY>';
    const uriBase = '<YOUR ENDPOINT>' + '/face/v1.0/detect';

    let params = new URLSearchParams({
        'returnFaceId': 'true',
        'returnFaceAttributes': 'emotion'
    })

    
    //COMPLETE THE CODE
    let resp = await fetch(uriBase + '?' + params.toString(), {
        method: '<METHOD>',  //WHAT TYPE OF REQUEST?
        body: '<BODY>',  //WHAT ARE WE SENDING TO THE API?
        headers: {
            '<HEADER NAME>': '<HEADER VALUE>'  //do this in the next section
        }
    })

    let data = await resp.json();
    
    return data; 
}
```
</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary>❓How do I specify Request Headers?</summary>
</br>

Go back to the Face API documentation [here](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395236), and find the **Request headers** section. 

There are two headers that you need. I've provided the format below. Enter in the two header names and their two corresponding values. 

FYI: The `Content-Type`  header should be set to`'application/octet-stream'`.  This specifies a binary file.

```js
    //COMPLETE THE CODE
    let resp = await fetch(uriBase + '?' + params.toString(), {
        method: '<METHOD>',  //WHAT TYPE OF REQUEST?
        body: '<BODY>',  //WHAT ARE WE SENDING TO THE API?
      
      	//ADD YOUR TWO HEADERS HERE
        headers: {
            '<HEADER NAME>': '<HEADER VALUE>'
        }
    })
```

<summary>❓How do I actually analyze the image?</summary>
</br>

Call the `analyzeImage` function in `module.exports`. Add the code below into `module.exports`.

Remember that `parts` represents the parsed multipart form data. It is an array of parts, each one described by a filename, a type and a data. Since we only sent one file, it is stored in index 0, and we want the `data`  property to access the binary file– hence `parts[0].data`. Then in the HTTP response of our Azure function, we store the result of the API call.

```js
//module.exports function

//analyze the image
var result = await analyzeImage(parts[0].data);

context.res = {
	body: {
		result
	}
};

console.log(result)
context.done(); 

```
