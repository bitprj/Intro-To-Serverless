# Getting Emotional ~ Calling the Giphy API

## ‚úÖ Task:
**Call the GIPHY API with the dominant emotion of a picture**
- [ ] 1. Create a GIPHY account and save your API key as a Function App Secret
- [ ] 2. In `emotionalgifs`, call the GIPHY API in a `GET` request with the dominant emotion
- [ ] üöÄ  Commit your updated function code to `emotionalgifs/index.js` on the `emotionalgifs` branch

## :construction: Test your work
Create a `POST` request in Postman. Use the **function URL** as the request URL, and send an image in the body of the request:

<details>
<summary>:white_check_mark: Expected Output</summary>
</br>
The link outputted by the function should look something like this: <br><br>

`https://giphy.com/gifs/happy-spongebob-squarepants-happiness-brHaCdJqCXijm`

## 1. Using the GIPHY API
We're going to connect the your first Azure function, `emotionalgifs`, with the GIPHY API.

### Creating a GIPHY Account
Set up an account by clicking [here](https://giphy.com/join) and enter an **email address**, **username**, and **password**.

### Generating an API Key
According to the [documentation](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint#translate), an API key is a required parameters in a call to GIPHY's **translate endpoint**. The link (for gifs) that is listed in the documentation is the **endpoint** we will be using in this project.

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I create an API key?</summary>
</br>

To create an **API key** click [here](https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/) and click Create an App. <br>

Select API, **not** SDK! <br>
<img width="663" alt="Screen Shot 2021-04-15 at 5 55 32 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70852990/114943349-daf52c00-9e13-11eb-870e-0be1998c2e04.png">

Then, enter the required information. <br>
<img width="663" alt="Screen Shot 2021-04-15 at 5 55 41 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70852990/114943355-dd578600-9e13-11eb-8257-1d9b65f8f5f1.png">

Click **Create App**, and your key should be given.

Next, store your API key in your Azure Function's environment secrets.

</details>

## 2. Modifying the Azure Function
We will be calling the GIPHY API in the same function that analyzes inputted images.

Create another **async function** in `emotionalgifs` called `findGifs`. It needs a parameter through which we can pass the **dominant emotion** of an image. Call this parameter `emotion`.

> :bulb: Use the [documentation](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint#translate) to create a request to the Giphy API in the function.

<details>
<summary>:question: How do you call the GIPHY API?</summary>
</br>

We're going to call the GIPHY API inside our new async function using `fetch`. Use the **translate endpoint** from the [documentation](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint#translate). HINT:¬†we want the dominant emotion from the image to be the **search term**, and we only want **1 gif** to be returned.
```js
//COMPLETE THE CODE
const apiResult = await fetch ("https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/translate?//WHAT GOES HERE?");
```

> **Hint**: If you read the documentation correctly, you should see that you need to use your API key in the request. Remember to access your environment secrets, you can use `process.env['the secret name']`

We need to convert the content of `apiResult` into **JSON format**. Remember, we're using the `await` keyword because `fetch` (which we used to call the GIPHY API) returns a Promise, and a Promise is a **proxy** for a value that isn't currently known.
```js
const jsonResult = await //WHAT GOES HERE?.json();
```

Finally, we need to return a specific link from the JSON file stored in `jsonResult`:
```js
return //WHAT GOES HERE.data.url;
```

<br><br/>
</details>

Now that you have a async function that can can the Giphy API with an emotion and return a gif link, you need to **incorporate it** in the main `module.exports` function.

> **TIP**: Use `await` to receive a response from the function since it is async!
<details>
<summary>‚ùó How should I call the findGifs function we wrote?</summary>
</br>

Let's call `findGifs` in the first async function in `emotionalgifs`. Currently, our first async function looks like this:
```js
module.exports = async function (context, req) {
    context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.');

    var boundary = multipart.getBoundary(req.headers['content-type']);
    var body = req.body;
    var parts = multipart.Parse(body, boundary);

    var result = await analyzeImage(parts[0].data);

    let emotions = result[0].faceAttributes.emotion;
    let objects = Object.values(emotions);
    const main_emotion = Object.keys(emotions).find(key => emotions[key] === Math.max(...objects));

    context.res = {
        // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
        body: main_emotion
    };
    console.log(result)
    context.done();
}
```

We need to declare another variable, `gif`. It needs to store the link returned when our new async function, `findGifs`, is called. Also, the **dominant emotion** from our analyzed image needs to be passed through the `emotion` parameter.
```js
var gif = await //WHAT GOES HERE?
```

Finally, we need our new variable `gif` to be the output of `emotionalgifs` rather than `main_emotion`:
```js
context.res = {
    // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
    body: //WHAT GOES HERE?
};
```
