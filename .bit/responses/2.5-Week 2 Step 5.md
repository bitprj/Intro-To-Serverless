## Week 2 Step 5

### Create a Face [API Endpoint](https://smartbear.com/learn/performance-monitoring/api-endpoints/#:~:text=For%20APIs%2C%20an%20endpoint%20can,to%20carry%20out%20their%20function.&text=The%20place%20that%20APIs%20send,lives%2C%20is%20called%20an%20endpoint.)

This step is fairly straightforward: 

1. Log into your Azure portal
2. Press **Create a Resource**
3. Press the **AI + Machine Learning** tab on the left
4. Press **Face** and fill out the necessary information

Record and save the API endpoint and [subscription key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-subscriptions), as we'll be using it in the following parts.

If you cannot find the keys:
* Navigate to the home page on the Micrsoft Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/#home)

*What does the Face API do?*

> The Face API will accept the image and return information about the face, specifically emotions.

**To move on, place your two secrets in the repository secrets: `API_ENDPOINT` AND `SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`**
