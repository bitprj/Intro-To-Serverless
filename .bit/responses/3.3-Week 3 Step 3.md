## Week 3 Step 3

### Sending the GIF

Now, you're going to **connect the Twilio and Giphy APIs**! You will send a gif to a user with the Twilio API. You should have the message code already written and your Twilio account set up from Week 2.

## **:pencil: Task 3: Send the GIF to the User with the Twilio SMS API.** <br>

</br>

1. Open your **trigger function** and find the lines you coded in Week 2. The `body` and `mediaURL` values in `client.messages.create` should be empty.
2. Set the `body` value to a **string**, which will inform the user that they have recieved their requested gif. Add the `emotion` constant to your message too!
3. Set the `mediaURL` value to a specific link from the **gif data**.

</br>

<details>
<summary>:question: I'm not sure exactly what I should put in the object values.</summary>
  </br>
  
The `body` value should be a **string** that looks something like this: _Hello! That is the ${add emotion constant here!} gif you requested :)_. <br> <br>
The `mediaURL` value should be this **link** from the returned gif data: **jsonResult.data.images.downsized_large.url**

  <br>
</details>

Now, when your function runs, it should send a gif to a user's phone number!

## **:camping: To move on, commit your `client.messages.create` code as a `.js` file to the root directory of the `week3` branch.**

*Remember: **remove** your Twilio phone number before committing your code!*
