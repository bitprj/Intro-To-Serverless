# Codename Blob + 3RR0R Handling
*This week, you will be going through steps to handle POST requests with no data.*

## ✅  Task:

- [ ] ***1:*** Modify your function code so that it receives a header value called `codename` and uses it to name the image.
  - If an image isn't attached, return "Sorry! No image attached."
  - If an image is attached, return the output of the `uploadFile()` function
- [ ] 🚀 Commit your updated function code to `bunnimage/index.js` to the `bunnimage` branch

## 🚧 Test Your Work

To test your work, use Postman to send a POST request *without* an image attached. You should see a response similar to the below:

```JSON
{
  "body" : "Sorry! No image attached."
}
```
> 💡 Yay! This means the error was successfully caught.

## 1: Modify the Function

### Handle Empty Data

Now we'll want to handle cases where the POST request's body happens to be empty. In your original `module.exports` function, before you parse the body, make sure it exists! Only then should you upload your file to blob storage.

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I catch empty POST requests?</summary>

Use an try-catch statement to catch when `parse-multipart` is unable to parse the empty body. If catches an error, set the `responseMessage` to "Sorry! No image attached." Otherwise, you can safely parse the body!

```js
let responseMessage = ""
try {
    let password = // get the header called "codename"
    // use parse-multipart to parse the body
    // determine the file-type here!
    responseMessage = await uploadFile((place your parsedBody here), (place the extension here), (place the "codename" here));
    // fill the parameters in!
} catch(err) {
    context.log("Undefined body image");
    responseMessage = "Sorry! No image attached."
}
```
> :bulb: Hint: `responseMessage` is what we're returning to the user as the output.
</details>

> :bulb: Hint: You'll need to add another parameter to the `uploadFile` function since it now has to receive the body, extension, AND filename! 
### Headers
Headers are yet another way to pass on information in HTTP requests. Here's how to access them:
```js
let the_header_value = req.headers['insert_header_name'];
```
In this case, the header value will be used to name our picture.
