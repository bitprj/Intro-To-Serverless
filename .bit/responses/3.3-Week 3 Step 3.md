## Codename Blob + 3RR0R Handling
*This week, you will be going through steps to handle POST requests with no data.*

### ✅  Task:

- [ ]  Make sure you're on the `week3` branch
- [ ]  Modify your function code so that it receives a header value called `codename`.
- [ ]  Handle cases where if an image isn't attached, return "Sorry! No image attached."
- [ ]  If an image is attached, return the output of the `uploadFile()` function
- [ ]  Commit your updated function code to `bunnimage/index.js`

### Handle Empty Data

Now we'll want to handle cases where the POST request's body happens to be empty. In your original `module.exports` function, before you parse the body, make sure it exists! Only then should you upload your file to blob storage.

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I catch empty POST requests?</summary>

Use an if-else statement to catch when `body == ""`. If it's empty, set the `responseMessage` to "Sorry! No image attached." Otherwise, you can safely parse the body!

```js
var responseMessage = ""
if (body == "" || body == undefined) {
    responseMessage = "Sorry! No image attached."
} else {
    var password = // get the header called "codename"
    var parsedBody = multipart.Parse(body, boundary);
    responseMessage = await uploadFile(parsedBody, password);
}
```
> :bulb: Hint: `responseMessage` is what we're returning to the user as the output.
</details>

### Headers
Headers are yet another way to pass on information in HTTP requests. Here's how to access them:
```js
var the_header_value = req.headers['insert_header_name'];
```
In this case, the header value will be used to name our picture.

### Test Your Work

To test your work, use Postman to send a POST request *without* an image attached. You should see a response similar to the below:

```JSON
{
  "body" : "Sorry! No image attached."
}
```
> 💡 Yay! This means the error was successfully caught.
