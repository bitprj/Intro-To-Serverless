## Determine the Scope of your Project

Now that we have successfully completed learning about Serverless architecture and practiced using Azure functions, let's get creative and start building out our project.

The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a solution for a real world problem within one of the three following categories:
🌍 Earth, environment, and sustainability
💚 Productivity, health, and medicine
🎨 Entertainment, art, and community

Here are some leading questions you can ask yourself to help make a decision:
🧩 What types of games/shows/movies/genres do you find interesting?
🎒 What are some struggles that you have faced in life/in the last year?
⚡️ What are some struggles your friends/family have faced?
💻 What types of apps do you like interacting with?
🗣 What type of impact do you want to leave in the world?
🤝 When in doubt, ask your friends/mentors/teachers/professors/co-workers for advice!

[Here are some example blogs written by students in the past!](https://bitproject.org/blog)
