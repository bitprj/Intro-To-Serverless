### Mapping it out

To get started with building, you will first need to create a flowchart showing the flow of information and components they will include to make there project work. Nothing has to be finalized, but planning it out allows you to organize your ideas and thought processes.

### Purpose of Programming Flowcharts

- Plan before the development phase helps you save a lot of hours of work
- Document your project and communicate how it works to others (this is really valuable when someone else is helping you debug your code)
- Prevent major technical issues with your code before you event start
- Ensure that you are more effectively using all the technologies available to you
- You will need to refer back to the flowchart while developing to review your work and sometimes come up with new ideas
