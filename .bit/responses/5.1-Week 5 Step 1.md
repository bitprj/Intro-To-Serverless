## Week 5 Step 1

### Laying out the groundwork

Once your proposal has been approved by your instructors and mentors, you can begin developing the project.

You want to start by creating a folder in this repo where you will be saving all of your project related files, called "project".

### Mapping it out

To get started with building, students will first need to create a flowchart showing the flow of information and components they will include to make there project work. Nothing has to be finalized, but planning it out allows students to organize their ideas and thought processes.

## **:camping: To move on, create a new branch called "week5-flowchart", commit an image file of your flowchart, and comment a description of the flowchart!**
