## Laying out the groundwork

### ‚úÖ  Task:

- [ ]  Create a new [Figma](figma.com) file named "Serverless Camp Project"
- [ ]  In this file, create a flowchart showing the flow of information and components involved in your project including any Azure Functions and APIs you plan on using
- [ ]  Export the flowchart as a png file 
- [ ]  Create a branch named `week5`
- [ ] Create a folder in this repo where you will be saving all of your project related files, called "project"
- [ ]  Upload the flowchart into the project folder and commit your changes to move on

### Mapping it out

To get started with building, students will first need to create a flowchart showing the flow of information and components they will include to make there project work. Nothing has to be finalized, but planning it out allows students to organize their ideas and thought processes.

### Purpose of Programming Flowcharts

- When it comes to understanding programming or a logical structure, programming flowcharts are the best way of working.
- When a designer is creating a program, there can be certain loopholes that can hinder the progress. To avoid that, they can design the app or website with programming flowcharts before working on them.
- The engineer working on the debugging process can look at the programming flowchart, making it easier to debug the program.
- For reviewing a program, the designer may need to look at the programming flowchart.
- They can analyze the program with the help of the logical diagram of the flowchart and then modify it as per their requirement.
- Planning before the development phase helps developers save a lot of hours of work
- The flowchart can help you document your project and communicate how it works to other people
