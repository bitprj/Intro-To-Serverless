Week 5 Step 1 ‚¨§‚óØ‚óØ‚óØ‚óØ‚óØ | üïê Estimated completion: 1-2 hours

## Laying out the groundwork

### ‚úÖ  Task:

- [ ] Open the tech.md template file in the "project" folder (where you will be saving all of your project related files)
- [ ] In that file, create a list of the Azure services you expect to create/use for your project and what specific purpose they serve for your project
- [ ] Create a list of the external APIs you expect to create/use for your project and what specific purpose they serve for your project
- [ ] Create a list of the npm packages, libraries, and/or databases you expect to create/use for your project and what specific purpose they serve for your project
- [ ] Create a list of the frontend languages you expect to create/use for your project and what specific purpose they serve for your project
- [ ] Create a branch named `week5`
- [ ] Commit your changes to move on

### Mapping it out

To get started with building, you will first need to create a flowchart showing the flow of information and components they will include to make there project work. Nothing has to be finalized, but planning it out allows you to organize your ideas and thought processes.

### Purpose of Programming Flowcharts

- Plan before the development phase - this helps you save a lot of hours of work
- Document your project and communicate how it works to others (this is really valuable when someone else is helping you debug your code)
- Prevent major technical issues with your code before you event start
- Ensure that you are more effectively using all the technologies available to you
- You will need to refer back to the flowchart while developing to review your work and sometimes come up with new ideas

### Preparing a Checklist

As a beginner developer, it is vital that you consider the pros and cons of different technologies before you decide to use them. In this case, you are relatively profient with Azure functions and certain APIs, but for your final project you might find yourself looking into new softwares that you have't interacted before, talking to professionals about them, reading their documentation, and using them in your project.

You will need to be able to justify your decisions confidently in order to prevent making decisions that will cost you excess time and effort in the developing phase. For this, you will need to start conducting extension research on how the technologies work and how they will be interacting with each other.

### Researching APIs (and other technologies)

There are thousands of amazing APIs that all have various functions, and there is no limit to the number of APIs you can use for your project. Here are a couple ways you can find the right API for your project:

- If you already know what purpose you want your API to serve (e.g. find a location, send an SMS, ...) start with a simple Google search or filter through online lists such as [rapidapi.com](rapidapi.com)
- If you're looking for project inspiration through cool new APIs, online lists such as [rapidapi.com](https://rapidapi.com/categories) have tags/categories that you can filter through to get some ideas 
- When in doubt, talk to people in the tech industry or try watching some API workshops to see what is out there

Some of the most popular API categories previously seen in Serverless Camps include:
- SMS notifications (e.g. Twilio API)
- Location based APIs
- Food related APIs
- Weather APIs

Although these are great places to start and can build very valuable and functional apps, you want to spice up your own project by using less conventional APIs as well that give your project an edge and make them stand out. This project is your crown jewel from the Serverless Camp. Make it memorable and have fun with it!
