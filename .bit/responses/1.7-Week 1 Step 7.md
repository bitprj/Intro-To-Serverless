## Name your Cat

## ✅  Task:
- [ ] Run `git pull`
- [ ] ***1:*** Modify your Azure Function to output TWO randomly generated cat pictures from the cat API and TWO names from list below:
    * "Shreya, Emily, Fifi, Beau, Evelyn, Julia, Daniel, Fardeen"
- [ ] ***2:*** Return the images and names in **JSON format** in the body
    ```js
    body: {
        cat1: your-first-catpicture-in-base64,
        cat2: your-second-catpicture-in-base64,
        names: [name1, name2]
    }
    ```
- [ ] 🚀 Commit your updated function code in `TwoCatz/index.js` to the `twocatz` branch

> :exclamation: **Do not merge the branch!!**

### Specifications
- [ ] API endpoint: https://cataas.com/cat/cute/says/Bitcamp
- [ ] Return the images encoded in **base64**

> :bulb: The Base64 is shortened for clarity!
Input the base64 into [this converter](https://base64.guru/converter/decode/image) to see whether your images are correct.

> **Hint:** Remember what we did in step 6? You're going to have to make two of those requests for a two cat pictures, so create two *different variables* for each request to get two unique pictures. 

## 🚧 Test your Work
When you paste your **Function URL** in your browser or make a GET request with **Postman**, you might get something like:
```json
{
  "cat1": "/9j/4AAQSk...",
  "cat2": "R0lGODlhCwHI...",
   "names": [
    "Daniel",
    "Shreya"
  ]
```

<summary>:exclamation: How can I select random items out of a list?</summary>
    </br>

**Hint 1:** You'll need to create an array with the names first.
**Hint 2:** You'll need to generate a random number within the range of the array length.

<details>
<summary>🔵 Need a step-by-step?</summary>
    </br>

1. Create an array with the names:
```js
var names = ["name1", "name2"...]
```

2. Generate a random value in the correct range:
```js
var random_value = Math.floor(names.length * Math.random())
```

3. Get the name!
```js
var resultname = names[random_value]
```
Wrap the code for generating a random combination into a function called `nameFinder()` and return resultname.

*Call nameFinder() twice to get two names!*

<summary>:exclamation: Now that I've got everything, how do I return it?</summary>
    </br>

`context.res` is the key to answering this question!

To return your two images and two names in the output:
```js
context.res = {
    body: {
        cat1: your-first-catpicture-in-base64,
        cat2: your-second-catpicture-in-base64,
        names: [name1, name2]
    }
}
```
