<summary>:question: What is blob storage?</summary>
</br>

Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that doesn't adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data. Read more about it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction)!

### Creating a Blob Storage Account and its Resources

#### :question: What is a blob storage account?

A storage account provides a unique namespace in Azure for your data. **Every object that you store in Azure Storage has an address that includes your unique account name.** The combination of the account name and the Azure Storage blob endpoint forms the base address for the objects in your storage account. For example, if your storage account is named `mystorageaccount`, then the default endpoint for Blob storage is: http://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net
