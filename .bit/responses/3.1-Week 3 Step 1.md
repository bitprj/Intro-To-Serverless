## Week 3 Step 1

In week 2, you should've learned the basics of how to create an Azure Function and use the Giphy and Twilio APIs. This week, we'll be looking into using [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/), a powerful NoSQL database.

### Learning Objectives
* Creating a Cosmos account and database
* Entering data into your database from an Azure Function

<br>

### Creating a Cosmos Account

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Search for and select **Azure Cosmos DB**.
3. Select **Add**.
4. Fill in the information.
    1. Select your Azure subscription from the dropdown.
    2. Create a new resource group, and enter a unique name for it. I'll call mine `emotion_group`.
    3. Enter an **Account Name** that you'll use to identify your Azure Cosmos account. Because *documents.azure.com* is appended to the name that you provide to create your URI, use a unique name. This can be something like your GitHub username.
    4. The **API** determines what type of account you want to create. Azure Cosmos DB provides five APIs: Core (SQL) and MongoDB for document data, Gremlin for graph data, Azure Table, and Cassandra. We'll be leaving our API as **Core (SQL)** for now.
    5. For the **Location** that will be hosting your Cosmos account, select one from the dropdown that will be closest to your users. If you're not sure which location to pick, go ahead and select one that is closest to you.
    6. For capacity mode, [here's](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/throughput-serverless) a detailed comparison between **Provisioned throughput** and **Serverless (preview)**. We'll be sticking with **Provisioned throughput** since this is meant to be a small project that just demonstrates the functionality of Azure.
    7. We will keep the rest of the settings the same.

5. Click **Review + create**. Make sure all of the information is listed the way you want it, and click **Create**.
6. Wait for the portal page to display **Your deployment is complete**. Select **Go to resource** to go to the Azure Cosmos DB account page.

### Creating a Cosmos Database

1. Once you've created your Account, you can now create a database! Navigate to your Azure Cosmos DB account page, and select **Data Explorer**.
2. Select **New Container**.

3. Enter a **Database ID**. *Please write this ID down somewhere and mark it as your database ID! We will need it for later configuration.* I will call mine `emotion_database`.
4. Leave **Throughput** option as is.
5. Enter a **Container ID**. *Please also write this ID down somewhere and mark it as your container ID! We will need it for later configuration.* I will call mine `emotion_container`.
6. For our partition key, we can simply put down `/id` for now. With each data document you create, Azure will automatically assign some ID value to the document. We will see this in action later on.

7. Select **OK**.
