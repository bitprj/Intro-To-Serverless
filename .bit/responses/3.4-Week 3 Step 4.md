Week 3 Step 4 ⬤⬤⬤⬤◯◯◯◯◯ | 🕐 Estimated completion: 10-20 minutes

## Your time's up....
*This week, you will be going through steps to create a Timer Trigger Function delete all files in your Blob storage container every 5 minutes. This allows for greater security for your users.*

### ✅  Task:

- [ ]  Make sure you're on the `week3` branch
- [ ]  Create a Timer Trigger Function to delete all files in your Blob storage container every 5 minutes.
- [ ]  Test your new Timer Trigger Function
- [ ]  Commit your completed Timer Trigger to `bunnimage/timer.js`
- [ ]  To move on, comment an expression that tells the Timer Trigger to run everyday at 6:23 AM.

> :bulb: **Tip:** [Cron expressions](https://crontab.guru/) might help you with the last task.

### 🚧 Test Your Work

To test your work, use Postman to send a POST request with an image to your previous HTTP trigger function that will save your file within your blob. Recall that a successful save of your file will cause you to see a response similar to the below:

```JSON
{
  "body" : "File Saved"
}
```

You should also double check that your file has been saved by navigating to your storage blobs.

Now run your timer trigger function and re-check your storage blobs - they should be gone. Your logs notifying you of the blobs' deletions should also be displayed in your trigger function's console. 

> 💡 Yay! This means your timer trigger function worked.

### Create your Timer Trigger Function

First, we'll need to create a new Azure Function that will be triggered by a timer instead of an HTTP Request.

<summary>:question: How do I create an Azure Function?</summary>

1.  Navigate to your Function App. On the left menu, click Functions, and then the `+ Add` button.

2. Choose a `Timer Trigger`, and leave the `Schedule` as `0 */5 * * * *` to have the function be triggered [every 5 minutes](https://crontab.guru/every-5-minutes).

3. Click Add.

### Code your Timer Trigger Function

Once your function has been created, click `Code + Test` on the left menu so we can begin coding!

In our function, we will need to accomplish the following things:

1. Instantiate a global reference to:
   
    - the `@azure/storage-blob` package 
    - the storage connection string
    - your storage account name

2. Create a `deleteBlob(filename)` function that deletes the block blob named `filename`. 

3. Within our main function, make a call to our `deleteBlob` function every five minutes.

<summary>:question: Where do I find my storage account's connection string?</summary>

Navigate to your storage account in Azure portal.

<summary>:question: How do I create the global variables above?</summary>

To reference the `@azure/storage-blob` package:

```js
const { BlobServiceClient } = require("@azure/storage-blob");
```

To reference your connection string and account name:

```js
const connectionstring = process.env["AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING"];
const account = "bunnimagestorage";
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I delete a blob?</summary>

First, your `deleteBlob` function will have to be asynchronous, so its signature should look like `async function deleteBlob(filename)`. 

Inside your function, create a `BlobServiceClient` object that will be used to create a container client.

```js
const blobServiceClient = await BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString(connectionstring);
```

Create a variable that references the name of the container that contains the file you want to delete.

```js
const deletecontainer = "images";
```

Fetch the container with that name.

```js
const deletecontainerClient = await blobServiceClient.getContainerClient(deletecontainer);
```

Within that container, fetch the block blob client that has the name of `filename`.

```js
const deleteblockBlobClient = deletecontainerClient.getBlockBlobClient(filename);
```

[Download](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/@azure/storage-blob/blockblobclient?view=azure-node-latest#download_number__number__BlobDownloadOptions_) the blob from the system and fetch a reference to the readable stream.

```js
const downloadBlockBlobResponse = await deleteblockBlobClient.download(0); // 0 refers to the position of the blob to download
```

Delete the blob.

```js
const blobDeleteResponse = deleteblockBlobClient.delete();
```

Set and return `result` with a progress statement on the blob's deletion.

```js
result = {
    body : {
        deletename: filename,
        success: true
    }
};
return result;
```

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I call the `deleteBlob` function within `module.exports`?</summary>

Exactly like the beginning of your `deleteBlob` function, you'll want to:
1. Create a `BlobServiceClient` object using your connection string.
2. Create a variable that references the name of the container that contains the file you want to delete.
3. Fetch the container with that name.

```js
const blobServiceClient = await BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString(connectionstring);
const deletecontainer = "images";
const deletecontainerClient = await blobServiceClient.getContainerClient(deletecontainer);
```

Now you'll want to use the [`listBlobsFlat`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/@azure/storage-blob/listblobsflatsegmentresponse?view=azure-node-latest) function to retrieve a reference to an enumeration of your blobs. Loop through these blobs, and delete each one.

```js
for await (const blob of deletecontainerClient.listBlobsFlat()) {
    context.log('\t', blob.name);
    await deleteBlob(blob.name)
}
```

You can also add a log after your for loop that notifies you that all the blobs have been deleted.

```js
context.log("Just deleted your blobs!")
```
