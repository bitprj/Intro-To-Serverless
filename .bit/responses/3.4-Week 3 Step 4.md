Week 3 Step 4 ⬤⬤⬤⬤◯◯◯◯◯ | 🕐 Estimated completion: 10-20 minutes

# Your time's up....
*This week, you will be going through steps to create a Timer Trigger Function delete all files in your Blob storage container every 5 minutes. This allows for greater security for your users.*

## ✅  Task:

- [ ]  1. Create a Timer Trigger Function to delete all files in your Blob storage container every 5 minutes.
- [ ]  2. Test your new Timer Trigger Function
- [ ]  🚀 _Don't_ commit your new code and comment an expression that tells the Timer Trigger to run everyday at 6:23 AM.

> :bulb: **Tip:** [Cron expressions](https://crontab.guru/) might help you with the last task.

## 🚧 Test Your Work

To test your work, use Postman to send a POST request with an image to your previous HTTP trigger function that will save your file within your blob. Recall that a successful save of your file will cause you to see a response similar to the below:

```JSON
{
  "body" : "File Saved"
}
```

You should also double check that your file has been saved by navigating to your storage blobs.

Now run your timer trigger function using `node index.js` and re-check your storage blobs - they should be gone. Your logs notifying you of the blobs' deletions should also be displayed in your trigger function's console. 

> 💡 Yay! This means your timer trigger function worked.

## 1. Create your Timer Trigger Function

First, we'll need to create a new Azure Function that runs on a schedule with the Timer Trigger template.

1.  Create a new Function, naming it `bunnimage-timer` and select `Timer trigger`

2. Leave the `Schedule` as `0 */5 * * * *` to have the function be triggered [every 5 minutes](https://crontab.guru/every-5-minutes).

3. Press enter on your keyboard.

## 1. Code your Timer Trigger Function

* Reference your container string from your environment secrets
* Reference the `@azure/storage-blob` package
* Reference your account name

<summary>:question: How do I create the global variables above?</summary>

To reference the `@azure/storage-blob` package:

```js
const { BlobServiceClient } = require("@azure/storage-blob");
```

To reference your connection string and account name:

```js
const connectionstring = process.env["AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING"];
const account = "YOUR_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME";
```

</details>

To **delete all the blobs** in the container, you can first list all the blobs, then loop through deleting each one as you go.

<summary>:question: How do I delete a blob?</summary>

First, your `deleteBlob` function will have to be asynchronous, so its signature should look like `async function deleteBlob(filename)`. 

Inside your function, create a `BlobServiceClient` object that will be used to create a container client.

```js
const blobServiceClient = await BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString(connectionstring);
```

Create a variable that references the name of the container that contains the file you want to delete.

```js
const deletecontainer = "images";
```

Fetch the container with that name.

```js
const deletecontainerClient = await blobServiceClient.getContainerClient(deletecontainer);
```

Within that container, fetch the block blob client that has the name of `filename`.

```js
const deleteblockBlobClient = deletecontainerClient.getBlockBlobClient(filename);
```

[Download](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/@azure/storage-blob/blockblobclient?view=azure-node-latest#download_number__number__BlobDownloadOptions_) the blob from the system and fetch a reference to the readable stream.

```js
const downloadBlockBlobResponse = await deleteblockBlobClient.download(0); // 0 refers to the position of the blob to download
```

Delete the blob.

```js
const blobDeleteResponse = deleteblockBlobClient.delete();
```

Set and return `result` with a progress statement on the blob's deletion.

```js
result = {
    body : {
        deletename: filename,
        success: true
    }
};
return result;
```

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I call the `deleteBlob` function within `module.exports` and loop through existing blobs?</summary>

Exactly like the beginning of your `deleteBlob` function, you'll want to:
1. Create a `BlobServiceClient` object using your connection string.
2. Create a variable that references the name of the container that contains the file you want to delete.
3. Fetch the container with that name.

```js
const blobServiceClient = await BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString(connectionstring);
const deletecontainer = "images";
const deletecontainerClient = await blobServiceClient.getContainerClient(deletecontainer);
```

Now you'll want to use the [`listBlobsFlat`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/@azure/storage-blob/listblobsflatsegmentresponse?view=azure-node-latest) function to retrieve a reference to an enumeration of your blobs. Loop through these blobs, and delete each one.

```js
for await (const blob of deletecontainerClient.listBlobsFlat()) {
    context.log('\t', blob.name);
    await deleteBlob(blob.name)
    // access the blob's name and call deleteBlob to delete it!
}
```

You can also add a log after your for loop that notifies you that all the blobs have been deleted.

```js
context.log("Just deleted your blobs!")
```
