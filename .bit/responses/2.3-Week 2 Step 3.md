## Gifs and More Gifs with Giphy API
You will be working with the Giphy API to return a GIF instead of a json file of emotion data. Why? Cause GIFS are fun. 


### ‚úÖ  Task:

- [ ]  run `git pull` 
- [ ]  make sure you are in the `week2` branch 
- [ ]  Create a Giphy API Key
- [ ]  Using `node-fetch`, modify your `emotional.js` function to return the results from the Giphy translate endpoint
- [ ] Commit your code to `week2/emotional.js`

## Huh? Giphy API?

**Giphy** is a database for finding and sharing animated GIFs. We are going to use their API. Our HTTP trigger function will call the Giphy API using the emotion data we recieved. Then, the Giphy API will find a GIF that matches the dominant emotion of the subject in the analyzed picture.

- To set up an account, go to: https://giphy.com/join and enter an **email address, username,** and **password**.

- To find the documentation, go to: https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint#translate. The link (for gifs) that is listed there is the endpoint we will be using in this project.
