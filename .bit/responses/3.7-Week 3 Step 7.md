# Leaky secrets
> Store a message from Twilio in CosmosDB and return the most recent message

## ‚úÖ  Task:
- [ ]  1. Configure CosmosDB and add your CosmosDB Endpoint and Key in Azure App settings as `COSMOS_ENDPOINT` and `COSMOS_KEY`
- [ ]  2. Write functions to store a message and retrieve the most recent entry
- [ ]  3. Take a message from a Twilio POST request's parameters and use your functions to return the most recent message
- [ ] üöÄ Commit your updated function code to `deepsecrets/index.js`to the `deepsecrets` branch

‚ùó Make sure to **return your message** in this format:
```
Thanks üòä! Stored your secret "insert_user's_message". üòØ Someone confessed that: "the_most_recent_message"
```

## üöß Test Your Work

To test your work, send your Twilio number a text message. Once you do so, if you navigate to your Cosmos database account, go to Data Explorer, and the dropdowns underneath your new `SecretStorer` database, you should see an item that contains a message with your text message!

Important Note: If you are triggering the function for the first time, you may see an error message like the one below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49426183/120911569-46ea5880-c63d-11eb-89c3-18c0205dcef4.png)

Don't worry! Try sending another text message, and everything should work fine the second time around. This error occurs because you don't have anything stored in CosmosDB yet.

> üí° Yay! This means you've successfully connected Twilio with your Azure Cosmos database and Function.

## 1. Create your Cosmos Databases

Before we do anything else, we'll want to create our Cosmos DB account.

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I create my Cosmos DB account?</summary>

1. Navigate to your Azure Portal and click on `Azure Cosmos DB` under Azure Services.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49426183/120911257-90857400-c63a-11eb-9046-d9a7401e24af.png)

2. Click `Create Azure Cosmos DB Account`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49426183/120911303-405ae180-c63b-11eb-98eb-6a1fedcad05c.png)

3. Under `Select API Option`, choose `Core (SQL) - Recommended`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49426183/120911316-5d8fb000-c63b-11eb-8466-f7bfc938d1f8.png)

4. Fill in your account name, leave default options as they are, and click `Review + create`.

5. Click `Create` a final time.

6. Once deployment is complete, click `Go to resource`.

7. Before you return to VSCODE, record the Cosmos Database URI and Key. That should be under Setting/Keys
![Screenshot from 2021-07-08 21-05-47-edited_cosmo_key](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15052690/125008466-9357f800-e030-11eb-9241-ee1ef668e4e8.png)

8. Create new Azure function application settings per [Azure App Setting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings?tabs=portal#settings). Label them `COSMOS_ENDPOINT` with the cosmos URI as the value and `COSMOS_KEY` with the cosmos Key as the value.

## 1. Install @azure/cosmos

Now that your Azure Cosmos DB account is created, we should install the `npm` package `@azure/cosmos`.

## üîß 1. Configuration

First, we need to instantiate a variable `CosmosClient` from the `@azure/cosmos` package we just downloaded.

```js
const CosmosClient = require("@azure/cosmos").CosmosClient;
```

Create a **config object** that contains all of the sensitive information that we need to manipulate our data.

Call it `config`, and place keys for `endpoint`, `key`, `databaseId`, `containerId`, and `partitionKey`.

<details>
<summary>:question: What should my config object look like?</summary>

Here is an example of the config object. Make sure your databaseId, containerId, and partitionKey are correct.

```js
const config = {
  endpoint: process.env.COSMOS_ENDPOINT,
  key: process.env.COSMOS_KEY,
  databaseId: "SecretStorer",
  containerId: "secrets",
  partitionKey: {kind: "Hash", paths: ["/secrets"]}
};
```

</details>

## 2. The `create` Function

Now, we want to write an asynchronous `create` function that takes in the parameter of `client` (this will be our `CosmosClient`), `databaseId`, and `containerId`. 

The `create` function will:

‚≠êÔ∏è Use the client to create a database with an id of `databaseId` if it does not exist.

‚≠êÔ∏è Use the client to create a container inside the database of ID `databaseId`. This container will have an ID of `containerId` and a key of `partitionKey`.

‚≠êÔ∏è The `create` function should be `async` because within it we are accessing CosmosDB.

‚≠êÔ∏è The `create` function does not need to have a return value.

‚ùì How do we do this?

Read Microsoft's [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-nodejs-get-started) on how to create a database and container. 
You will need to find which part of the docs to use, because in the real-world, you aren't always given the picture perfect instructions. You will need to figure out what code you need.
  
> **Hint**: You don't need to create a new file like the docs say, because we already have our `index.js` file. 
> 
> You also do not need the [module.exports](https://stackify.com/node-js-module-exports/), because this function will be in our `index.js` file, and that is where we will be using it. 

> :bulb: **Hint**: The `config.[value]` variables are accessed from the `config` object you created earlier.

## üìú 2. The `createDocument` Function

‚≠êÔ∏è The `createDocument` async function will create a new document within the database container that contains the `newItem` data.

‚≠êÔ∏è `newItem` should be a parameter that is passed into the `createDocument` function.

‚≠êÔ∏è return your `items` object from the function **which contains the most recent message.**

1. In the `createDocument` function, we first need to establish a connection with your Azure Cosmos account. This way, your code can tell the database what it wants, and the database will respond!
2. In order to create this connection, read these [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-nodejs-get-started#connect-to-the-azure-cosmos-account)
> Note: remember when we created the `create` function? We need to use that function now! You will need to slightly modify one line of code in the docs to work with yoru `create` function!
3. After creating a connection with the CosmosDB, we need to [query the database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-nodejs-get-started#QueryItem) for the most recent document (so you can see someone else's secret üëÄ)
> Note: Instead of their SQL query, we need to use `SELECT top 1 * FROM c order by c._ts desc` to only get the most recent document!
5. After stealing someone else's secret, it is only fair that we upload our own!
6. We need to [create a new item in the database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-nodejs-get-started#CreateItem)!
7. Return that secret that we stole ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è

## 3. The Main Function

Instead of directly passing `queryObject.Body` (the SMS message) to `context.res`:

‚≠êÔ∏è You'll instead save it in a JSON object with a key of `message`.

‚≠êÔ∏è Then, pass the JSON object containing the SMS message into the `createDocument` function you just coded to get your `items` object.

‚≠êÔ∏è Finally, create a custom response that you can send back to the original texter.

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I create a new document with queryObject.Body?</summary>

```js
const queryObject = // use the `qs` npm package to parse the request body
let message = queryObject.Body;
let document = // create an object with the string `"message"` as the key, and the variable `message` as its value
let items = // call the createDocument function with the document we just made
```

</details>

Your response message must adhere to this format! Make sure to change the variable names `message` and `items` if you named them something different.

```js
const responseMessage = `Thanks üòä! Stored your secret "${message}". üòØ Someone confessed that: ${JSON.stringify(items[0].message)}`
```
