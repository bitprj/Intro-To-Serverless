## Building a Webpage with HTML/JS
Congrats! If you made it this far, your Azure functions can now return data. However, users won't want to make POST requests with Postman to use your API though, so let's make it more user friendly.


### ‚úÖ  Task:
<details>
<summary>‚öôÔ∏è Logistics Setup</summary>
- [ ]  Create a  `week4` branch 
- [ ]  Install [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for testing
</details>
- [ ]  *Optional* Learn HTML basics with the [interactive course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-html)
- [ ]  Create a `form` element with: `id="image-form"` and make it call `getImage` on submit.
- [ ]  Add an `input` and `button` element inside the `form`.
- [ ]  Create a `div` element with `id` of `output`
- [ ]  Write a `getImage` event handler function in `index.js` to display `input` appended with a ‚ù§Ô∏è in the `output` div 
- [ ] Commit your code to `bunnimage/index.html` and `bunnimage/index.js`

### üöß Test your Work
Use **[LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)**! This is a helpful VSCode extension that allows you to see your HTML that updates while you edit it.

* To start a local server, click `Go live` at the bottom right of the screen, as shown in the image.
    * Make sure that you have the entire repo open on VS Code and not just the individual files.
    * If this is your first time installing LiveServer, you might need to close/quit VS Code and reopen it.
* Test it out, and see what your HTML page looks like! *It's OK if it's boring, so feel free to style it with CSS!*

## HTML?
HTML is the language for describing the structure of Web pages. We are going to be building a form to get some user input, and display the user output. We are going to:

- [ ]  Create the HTML head element 
- [ ]  Create a `form` element with: `id="image-form"` and make it call `getImage` on submit.
- [ ]  Add an `input` and `button` element inside the `form`.
- [ ]  Create a `div` element with `id` of `output`

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I do that?</summary>
</br>

First, add this to the top of your HTML page. This is standard information every page usually has.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <meta name="description" content="">
    <meta name="author" content="">

    <title>WHAT'S THIS PROJECT CALLED?</title>

  </head>
```

Create a `body` tag. We're going to be putting code in here.
```html
<body>

  <!--We're putting stuff here!-->

</body>
```

### Create a title container
```html
      <div>
          <h1>Example Project</h1>
          <hr/>
      </div>
```

### Displaying output and entering input
First, create a `div`.
```html
<div>
  <!--We're putting stuff here!-->
</div>
```

**Where is the user going to input the text** In a form - make sure to change the values!.
```html
      <form>
        <div class="form-group">
          <div id="image-div">
                  <input type="text" id="name" class="c-form-input" name="name" /><br>
                  <input onclick="getImage()" class="c-btn c-btn--primary" value="Submit" type="button" />       
      </form>

      <hr/> <!--we're just creating a separation-->
```


**Where will the output be displayed?** Look out below!
```html
      <div id="fillthisin"></div>
```
This is where you'll see the output pop up!

## Linking JS and calling the Function
On websites, there are many different types of events that can occur. For example:
- The user selects a certain element or hovers the cursor over a certain element.
- The user chooses a key on the keyboard.
- A form is submitted.
- etc


Each available event has an event handler, which is a block of code (usually a JavaScript function that you as a programmer create) that runs when the event fires. When such a block of code is defined to run in response to an event, we say we are registering an event handler.

We need to create an event handler function called `handle(event) {}` triggered by when the someone **submits an image**.

Here's some code to start off with.
```js
function handle(event) {
  // add your code!
  event.preventDefault();
  // we're disabling reload here. Without this, the page would reload every time the button was pressed.
}
```

<details>
<summary>:exclamation: What is `.preventDefault()` </summary>
  </br>

Sometimes, you'll come across a situation where you want to prevent an event from doing what it does by default. The trouble comes when the user has not submitted the data correctly ‚Äî as a developer, you want to prevent the submission to the server and give an error message saying what's wrong and what needs to be done to put things right. 
<br>
we can call the preventDefault() function on the event object ‚Äî which stops the page from reloading every time the button was pressed!
</details>



<details>
<summary>:exclamation: How can I connect my JS file to my HTML?</summary>
  </br>

Great question! All we have to do is reference it just like we did with the jQuery.
```js
<script src="index.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```
> Place this directly under your jQuery reference.
