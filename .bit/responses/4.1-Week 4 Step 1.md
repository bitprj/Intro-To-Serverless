## Adding an Event Handler to your HTML Form!
#### Demo: [üê∞](https://week4step1.emilychen10.repl.co/)
*Congrats! If you made it this far, your Azure functions can now return data. However, users won't want to make POST requests with Postman to use your API though, so let's make it more user friendly.*

### ‚úÖ  Task:
- [ ]  Create a `bunnimage-frontend` branch 
- [ ]  Install [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for testing
- [ ]  *Optional* Learn HTML basics with the [interactive course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-html)
- [ ]  Modify an HTML form to call the `getImage` event handler function when the submit button is clicked
- [ ]  Write a `getImage` event handler function in `index.js` to display `input` appended with a ‚ù§Ô∏è in the `output` div
- [ ] Commit your code to `bunnimage/index.html` and `bunnimage/script.js`
- [ ] Create a pull request that merges `bunnimage-frontend` to `main`, but **do not merge it**

### üöß Test your Work
Use **[LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)**! This is a helpful VSCode extension that allows you to see your HTML that updates while you edit it.

* To start a local server, click `Go live` at the bottom right of the screen, as shown in the image.
    * Make sure that you have the entire repo open on VS Code and not just the individual files.
    * If this is your first time installing LiveServer, you might need to close/quit VS Code and reopen it.
* Test it out, and see what your HTML page looks like! *It's OK if it's boring, so feel free to style it with CSS!*

## Adding jQuery
jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code. We are going to be using the `.text` method to change the text displayed on the `output` div. 

- [ ] Import Jquery 
- [ ] Create & Reference `index.js` in `index.html`

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I import jQuery?</summary>

Put it **at the very end of the HTML page outside of all the tags!**
```html
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="../../assets/js/vendor/jquery.min.js"><\/script>')</script>
     
    <script src="index.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>:exclamation: How can I connect my JS file to my HTML?</summary>
  </br>

Great question! All we have to do is reference it just like we did with the jQuery.
```html
<head>
...
   <script src="index.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</head>
```
> Place this directly under your jQuery reference.

## Writing the Event Handler Function!
On websites, there are many different types of events that can occur. For example:
- The user selects a certain element or hovers the cursor over a certain element.
- The user chooses a key on the keyboard.
- A form is submitted.
- Curious for more? Look [here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events.asp)

We need to create an event handler function called `getImage()`, which triggers when someone **submits an image**.

We are going to do this by using the jQuery `text()` method. The syntax to set the text for a [div](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.ASP) is `$(selector).text(content)`. 

To learn more, read the docs [here](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/html_text.asp)


<details>
<summary>I'm confused on how to do this</summary>

- The selector should be `#output`, or the name of the div with a # in front.

- The content should be `document.getElementById("username").value + "‚ù§Ô∏è"`

> :bulb: We are retrieving the value of the "name" text box with this code!

`$('#output').text(document.getElementById("username").value + "‚ù§Ô∏è")`

</details>

## How do I call the event handler from my HTML form?

The `onclick` event executes a Javascript function when a button is clicked

```html
  <label>Code: </label> <br>
  <input type="text" id="username" name="name" /> <br>
  <input value="Submit" type="button" onclick="getImage()" />
```
