## Week 4 Step 1

### Connecting the Frontend to the 2nd HTTP Trigger

### Learning Objectives
* Working with the **frontend** of a webapp
* Connecting the **frontend** and an **Azure HTTP Trigger Function**

This week, you're going to **make a frontend call to your HTTP trigger function**! You will take the inputted _phone number_ and the _prominent emotion_ from the emotion data and call your **second HTTP trigger function**. 

## **:pencil: Task 1: Create the frontend.** <br>

</br>

1. Create a new folder in VSCode with a `.js` and an `.html` file.
2. Set up a simple webpage in the `.html` file.
3. Outside of the webpage body, set up two `div` tags, one inside the other. Give them unique ids, and make the second one hidden.
4. Create a `form` through which the user will submit their phone number.
5. Next, source your `.js` file so that when the user submits their phone number, the `.js` code that calls the 2nd HTTP Trigger function will run.

</br>

<details>
<summary>:question: I'm not exactly sure how to create the submission form.</summary>
  </br>

The form should look something like this:

```html

<form id="FILL_THIS_IN">

  <input type="text" name="phone" id="FILL_THIS_IN" accept="10" placeholder="FILL_THIS_IN">
  <input type="submit" value="FILL_THIS_IN" id="UNIQUE_ID_HERE"></input>

</form>

```

The first `<input>` tag creates a text input box (see `type="text"`?) where the user can enter their phone number.

The second `<input>` tag creates a submission button that, when clicked, makes the `.js` code (which we will create in a later step) run. This code will call the 2nd HTTP Trigger function you coded last week!

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I source the .js file?</summary>
  </br>

The sourcing should look like this:

```html

<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="../../assets/js/vendor/jquery.min.js"><\/script>')</script>
<script src="ENTER_JS_FILE_NAME" type="text/javascript"></script>

```

Now, once we complete the `.js` file, you will be able to connect your `html` and `js` code!

  <br>
</details>

Now, we need to work on the `.js` file and connect the two!

## **:camping: To move on, create and merge a pull request with your new code in `index.js` into the branch `week4`!**

_Remember to give each element a **unique** id!_
