## Adding an Event Listener to your HTML Form!
#### Demo: [üê∞](https://week4step1.emilychen10.repl.co/)
*Congrats! If you made it this far, your Azure functions can now return data. However, users won't want to make POST requests with Postman to use your API though, so let's make it more user friendly.*

### ‚úÖ  Task:
- [ ] ***1:*** Create a `bunnimage-frontend` branch 
- [ ] ***2:*** Install [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for testing
- [ ] ***3:*** *Optional* Learn HTML basics with the [interactive course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-html)
- [ ] ***4:*** Write JavaScript to listen for the form to be submitted and call a function
- [ ] ***5:*** Write a function in `index.js` to display `input` appended with a ‚ù§Ô∏è in the `output` div
- [ ] ***6:*** Commit your code to `bunnimage/index.html` and `bunnimage/script.js`
- [ ] ***7:*** Create a pull request that merges `bunnimage-frontend` to `main`, and only merge the pull request when the bot approves your changes! 

### üöß Test your Work
Use **[LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)**! This is a helpful VSCode extension that allows you to see your HTML that updates while you edit it.

* To start a local server, click `Go live` at the bottom right of the screen, as shown in the image.
    * Make sure that you have the entire repo open on VS Code and not just the individual files.
    * If this is your first time installing LiveServer, you might need to close/quit VS Code and reopen it.
* Test it out, and see what your HTML page looks like! *It's OK if it's boring, so feel free to style it with CSS!*

## Listening for events and calling a function
Before we get started with event handling, let's figure out our main goal!
1. First, the user will interact with our HTML form that **accepts an input.**
2. The event listener we will write will **listen for events**, specifically, the "submit" event when the user submits the form!
3. Our JavaScript function will append the heart to the user's input and display it.
## 1: What is the form and how does it create an event?

Here is how the form should look in the bunnimage index.html file:

```html
<form id="bunnForm">
   <label for="name">Code: </label> <br>
   <input type="text" id="username" name="name" aria-label="name" /> <br>
   <input value="Submit" type="submit" />
</form>
<br/>
<div id="output"></div>
```
> üí° **Tip:** The `for` attribute in the `<label>` and the `aria-label` attribute in the `<input>`element make the website more accessible to users needing assistive technologies such as screen readers. 

Notice the **type** attribute of the **input** tag: it has a value of `submit`. When a user clicks this button, it will trigger a **submit** event on the **form** that has an **id** of `bunnForm`.

## 2: How do we listen for events?
On websites, there are many different types of events that can occur. For example:
- The user selects a certain element or hovers the cursor over a certain element.
- The user chooses a key on the keyboard.
- A form is submitted.
- Curious for more? Look [here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events.asp)

Later on, we will need to create a function which triggers when someone **submits an image**,
but first we will create a function which changes content on the page when we 
submit text. The event listener triggers the JavaScript function when the form is submitted.

<details>
<summary>‚ùì I'm confused on how to do this</summary>

- In a new file named `index.js`, create a variable using the id **of the HTML form**:
   
```js
const bunnForm = document.getElementById('bunnForm');
```
- In your index.js file, create an event listener with an anonymous function.
Inside of the function, create a variable for the value that was input in 
the text box.
   
 ```js
bunnForm.addEventListener('submit', function (event) {
   const username = document.getElementById("username").value
});
```
   
> üí° We are retrieving the value of the "username" text box with this code!
> üí° The document.getElementById() method gets the value of the input text from the HTML.

- Create a variable to target html div with the id of "output" and use the 
textContent property to add a "‚ù§" to the value that was input for username.

> üí° By default, the website will reload whenever a user clicks submit. This leads to our text on the page that we set being cleared away. We can prevent this by adding this to the top of our function.

```js
event.preventDefault()
```
   
```js
bunnForm.addEventListener('submit', function (event) {
   event.preventDefault()
   const username = document.getElementById("username").value
   const output = document.getElementById("output")
   output.textContent = username + "‚ù§"
});
```
