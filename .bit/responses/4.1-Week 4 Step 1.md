## Building a Webpage with HTML/JS
Congrats! If you made it this far, your Azure functions can now return data. However, users won't want to make POST requests with Postman to use your API though, so let's make it more user friendly.


### ‚úÖ  Task:
- [ ]  Create a  `week4` branch 
- [ ]  Install [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for testing
- [ ]  Create a `form` element with: `id="image-form"` and make it call `getImage` on submit.
- [ ]  Add an `input` and `button` element inside the `form`.
- [ ]  Create a `div` element with `id` of `output`
- [ ]  Write a `getImage` javascript function to display `input` appended with a ‚ù§Ô∏è in the `output` div 
- [ ] Commit your code to `bunnimage/index.html` and `bunnimage/index.js`

### üöß Test your Work
Use **[LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)**! This is a helpful VSCode extension that allows you to see your HTML that updates while you edit it.

* To start a local server, click `Go live` at the bottom right of the screen, as shown in the image.
    * Make sure that you have the entire repo open on VS Code and not just the individual files.
    * If this is your first time installing LiveServer, you might need to close/quit VS Code and reopen it.
* Test it out, and see what your HTML page looks like! *It's OK if it's boring, so feel free to style it with CSS!*

## HTML?
HTML is the language for describing the structure of Web pages. We are going to be building a form to get some user input, and display the user output. We are going to:

- [ ]  Create the HTML head element 
- [ ]  Create a `form` element with: `id="image-form"` and make it call `getImage` on submit.
- [ ]  Add an `input` and `button` element inside the `form`.
- [ ]  Create a `div` element with `id` of `output`

<details>
<summary>:question: How do I do that?</summary>
</br>

First, add this to the top of your HTML page. This is standard information every page usually has.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <meta name="description" content="">
    <meta name="author" content="">

    <title>WHAT'S THIS PROJECT CALLED?</title>

  </head>
```

Create a `body` tag. We're going to be putting code in here.
```html
<body>

  <!--We're putting stuff here!-->

</body>
```

### Create a title container
```html
      <div>
          <h1>Example Project</h1>
          <hr/>
      </div>
```

### Displaying output and entering input
First, create a `div`.
```html
<div>
  <!--We're putting stuff here!-->
</div>
```

**Where is the user going to input the text** In a form - make sure to change the values!.
```html
      <form>
        <div class="form-group">
          <div id="image-div">
                  <input type="text" id="name" class="c-form-input" name="name" /><br>
                  <input onclick="getImage()" class="c-btn c-btn--primary" value="Submit" type="button" />       
      </form>

      <hr/> <!--we're just creating a separation-->
```


**Where will the output be displayed?** Look out below!
```html
      <div id="fillthisin"></div>
```
This is where you'll see the output pop up!

## jQuery
The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

Put it **at the very end of the HTML page outside of all the tags!**
```html
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="../../assets/js/vendor/jquery.min.js"><\/script>')</script>
     
    <script src="config.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

**Why?** We will be using [jQuery](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_intro.asp) later to display output.

## Linking JS and calling the Function
Now we need to create our main function called `handle(event) {}`. This function is called when the someone **submits an image**.

Here's some code to start off with.
```js
function handle(event) {
  // add your code!
  event.preventDefault();
  // we're disabling reload here. Without this, the page would reload every time the button was pressed.
}
```

<details>
<summary>:exclamation: How can I connect my JS file to my HTML?</summary>
  </br>

Great question! All we have to do is reference it just like we did with the jQuery.
```js
<script src="index.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```
> Place this directly under your jQuery reference.
