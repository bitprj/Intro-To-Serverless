## Week 1 Step 6

### Setting up the Emotion Reader Function

Create **a new HTTP trigger function** in your Azure portal along with the Function App. Navigate to your Function App. **This is not the function code, but the actual app service resource**. 

We will be using the `parse-multipart`  and `node-fetch` npm packages.

<details>
<summary>:question: Why do we need these "packages" and what are they?</summary>
  </br>

Packages are awesome! They're chunks of publicly available code that someone else has written to help make coding easier for everyone else. These packages reusable code that increases functionality in your code. 

Before the Azure Function can run the code we will write, we have to install all the necessary package dependencies. These packages contain **code that we will "depend on" in the application**; we have to install them in the console using `npm install`.

[What is the node-fetch package?](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch)

[What is the parse-multipart package?](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse-multipart)

**:pencil: Task 5: Make sure you've created a new Function App and installed `parse-multipart` and `node-fetch`.**

In the left tab, scroll down to **Console**.

![console](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52464195/93178238-cf5c4e00-f6e8-11ea-90ab-c42f746cf04e.png)

Enter these commands in order:

```sh
npm init -y 

npm install parse-multipart

npm install node-fetch
```
<details>
<summary>:exclamation: Woah! What just happened when they were installed?</summary>
  </br>

The first command created a **package.json** file to store your dependencies and essentially keeps track of what packages your application needs. The next two actually install the necessary packages with code, `parse-multipart` and `node-fetch`.

*Note: If you get red text like `WARN`, you can ignore it.*

</details>

## **:camping: To move on, place the function URL of your new HTTP Trigger as a repository secret named `FUNCTION_URL`. Then, commit your `package.json` file to the root directory of the `week1` branch.**

*Remember: we check to see if you've placed your secrets everytime you commit!*
