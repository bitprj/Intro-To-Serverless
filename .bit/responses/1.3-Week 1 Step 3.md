## Deliverin' Cat Pics with Postman? 
It is important to test your code as you write it. Postman is a great tool when trying to dissect RESTful APIs made by others or test ones you have made yourself. It offers a sleek user interface to make HTML requests, without the hassle of writing a bunch of code just to test your API.

*In this step, you will be using Postman to test the [Cataas API](cataas.com) by sending a GET request*

You can sign up for Postman [here](https://www.postman.com/)

### ✅  Task:

- [ ]  With Postman, send a GET request to the Cat Picture API and receive a cat picture with "Serverless" written on it 
- [ ]  Comment the picture you recieve in this Issue/Pull Request to Move On

### What are HTTP Requests?

> A [server](https://www.infotech.co.uk/blog/it-infrastructure-what-does-a-server-actually-do) is a computer that provides (serves) data to other computers, called clients. Client connect to servers through the internet.

Clients communicate with servers with through HTTP requests. For example, when you are on your favorite browser and look up YouTube.com, you are making an HTTP get request to the server to load the contents from YouTube.com.

### The Cataas (Cats as a Service) API
CATAAS is a REST API. A service that delivers images of cats. The main feature is that we can change the properties of images, add text, truncate the image, add a filter and more.

Try it out yourself:
* API endpoint: https://cataas.com/cat/cute/says/Bitcamp
* Parameters: `color` (color of the text) and `text` (font size)

1. **Specifying the API Endpoint:** Enter https://cataas.com/cat/cute/says/Bitcamp, which is the API endpoint, into the text box next to GET

2. **Setting Parameters:** Click on "Params" and enter `color` into Key and the color you want (eg. blue) into Value. Enter `size` into the next Key row and a number (eg. 50) into Value.
> **Note on parameters:** 
> * the `size` parameter refers to the font size of your caption. It has a limit at around 1,200.
> * Colors are pretty hit or miss; since the Cat API is on the web, but it generally adheres to HTML color names. Expect values such as "blue, green, yellow" to work.
> * The API can take very large words as input for the caption, however only **34** characters can be seen on the picture at one time .
3. **Click `Send` to get your cat picture**
