*This week, you will be going through steps to set up tools needed to be successful in this camp. If you are already familiar with some, feel free to skip to the end and complete the task to move on.*

### Azure

<details>
<summary>:question: So what is "Azure"?</summary>
    </br>
    
**According to Microsoft:**
> Azure is an ever-expanding set of cloud services to help your organization meet your business challenges. Itâ€™s the freedom to build, manage, and deploy applications on a massive, global network using your favorite tools and frameworks.
    
If you want to learn more about Azure and all its cloud applications, feel free to check out this [link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-azure/), an overview of its capabilities.

<summary>:exclamation: How do I create an account?</summary>
    </br>
    
To create an Azure account, go to: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/ and press **Start free** to be relocated to a signup page. After signing in with your Microsoft account and filling in your personal details, you will be asked to add a credit card. Rest assured, this is only for security purposes (preventing multiple free accounts per person), and **you won't be charged** unless you choose to buy a premium account, which we do not need for this course. 

If you need some help navigating Azure, check out this super helpful [resource](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/) provided by Microsoft.

## **:pencil: Task 3: Create and deploy an HTTP trigger Azure Function that outputs the current time and date.**

This time we'll try developing locally. Follow the directions in this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-develop-local) to set up and deploy your first Azure Function right in your local machine.

## **:camping: To move on, place your function URL in a [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) called `HTTP_ENDPOINT` so we can check your function. Remember to commit your code to the `week1` branch!**

*Note: Every time you make a new commit to `week1`, we will check your function by making a request.*
