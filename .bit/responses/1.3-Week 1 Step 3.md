## Deliverin' Cat Pics with Postman? 
It is important to test your code as you write it. Postman is a great tool when trying to dissect RESTful APIs made by others or test ones you have made yourself. It offers a sleek user interface to make HTML requests, without the hassle of writing a bunch of code just to test your API.

*In this step, you will be using Postman to test the [Cataas API](cataas.com) by sending a GET request*

You can sign up for Postman [here](https://www.postman.com/)

### ✅  Task:

- [ ]  With Postman, send a GET request to the Cat Picture API and receive a cat picture with "Serverless" written on it 
- [ ]  Comment the picture you recieve in this Issue/Pull Request to Move On

### What are HTTP Requests?

> A [server](https://www.infotech.co.uk/blog/it-infrastructure-what-does-a-server-actually-do) is a computer that provides (serves) data to other computers, called clients. Client connect to servers through the internet.

Clients communicate with servers with through HTTP requests. For example, when you are on your favorite browser and look up YouTube.com, you are making an HTTP get request to the server to load the contents from YouTube.com.

<details>
<summary>Get Request</summary>
A Get Request is used to retrieve and request data from a specified resource in a server. The information is iddentified by the Request-URL. In this case, you will use
a Get Request URL from the Catass API to receive a cat picture.

</details>


<details>
<summary>Post Request</summary>
A Post request are used to send data to a server to create or update a resource. The informration submitted to the server is archived in the request body of the HTTP request.
The HTTP post method is often used to send user-generated data to a server. An example could be uploading a picture to an Post URL.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Put Request</summary>
A Put request is similar to a Post request, but the difference is that Put requests are idempotent, meaning the results will always be the sabe if you call the Put request 
multiple times.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Delete Request</summary>
A Delete request is used to delete resources indicated by the URL and will remove the targeted resources.

### The Cataas (Cats as a Service) API
CATAAS is a REST API. A service that delivers images of cats. The main feature is that we can change the properties of images, add text, truncate the image, add a filter and more.

2. **Setting Parameters:** Click on "Params" and enter `color` into Key and the color you want (eg. blue) into Value. Enter `size` into the next Key row and a number (eg. 50) into Value.
> **Note on parameters:** 
> * the `size` parameter refers to the font size of your caption. It has a limit at around 1,200.
> * Colors are pretty hit or miss; since the Cat API is on the web, but it generally adheres to HTML color names. Expect values such as "blue, green, yellow" to work.
> * The API can take very large words as input for the caption, however only **34** characters can be seen on the picture at one time .
3. **Click `Send` to get your cat picture**
