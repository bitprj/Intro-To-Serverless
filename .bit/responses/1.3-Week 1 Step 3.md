## Week 1 Step 3

### Postman, APIs, and requests

<details>
<summary>:question: What is Postman and why do we need it?</summary>
  </br>

Later, when we begin to code our Azure Function, we are going to need to test it. 

**How?** Just like our final web app and the first function we will code, we'll be sending requests to the Function's endpoint.

  <br><br/>
</details>

You can install Postman from the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en) as a Chrome extension, or sign up [here](https://www.postman.com/)

<summary>:question: What is Postman going to do?</summary>
  </br>

1. After this step, we will code an Azure Function that needs testing.
2. We will also later use Postman to **send a POST request** to our Azure Function to test if it works, mimicking what our static website will do.

Our HTTP trigger Azure Functions will be an [API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY) that receives requests and sends back information.

To introduce you to sending requests to an API and how Postman works, we'll be **sending a GET request to an API this time.**

1. You can choose to sign up or skip and go directly to the app.

2. Close out all the tabs that pop up until you reach **this screen**

## **:pencil: Task 4: Send a GET request to the Cat Picture API and receive a cat picture with "Bitcamp" written on it in a specified color and text size.**

Try it out yourself:
* API endpoint: https://cataas.com/cat/cute/says/Bitcamp
* Parameters: `color` (color of the text) and `text` (font size)

<details>
<summary>Stuck? Check here:</summary>
<br>

1. **Specifying the API Endpoint:** Enter https://cataas.com/cat/cute/says/Bitcamp, which is the API endpoint, into the text box next to GET

2. **Setting Parameters:** Click on "Params" and enter `color` into Key and the color you want (eg. blue) into Value. Enter `size` into the next Key row and a number (eg. 50) into Value.
> **Note on parameters:** 
> * the `size` parameter refers to the font size of your caption. It has a limit at around 1,200.
> * Colors are pretty hit or miss; since the Cat API is on the web, but it generally adheres to HTML color names. Expect values such as "blue, green, yellow" to work.
> * The API can take very large words as input for the caption, however only **34** characters can be seen on the picture at one time .
3. **Click `Send` to get your cat picture**
