### Converting the checklist into a flowchart
1. **Create a shape** for each of the components from your checklist and **label them** inside their designated shape
2. **Draw lines** on all of the technologies that interact with each other
3. Near each line, use the previous bullet points you wrote to **describe the relationship between the technologies** starting with action verbs (e.g. between JS code/front-end --> Azure Function "Sends an HTTP Post Request with uploaded image)
4. Use **arrow heads** to show the direction in which one technology is impacting another
