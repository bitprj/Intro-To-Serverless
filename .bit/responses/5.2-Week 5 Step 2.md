### Converting the checklist into a flowchart
1. Create a circular/square shape/block for each of the components from your checklist and write their names inside their designated shape
2. Draw lines on all of the technologies that interact with each other
3. Near each line, use the previous bullet points you wrote to describe the relationship between the technologies starting with action verbs (e.g. between JS code/front-end --> Azure Function "Sends an HTTP Post Request with uploaded image)
4. Use arrow heads to show the direction in which one technology is impacting another
