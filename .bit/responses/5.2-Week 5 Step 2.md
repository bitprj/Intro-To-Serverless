## Week 5 Step 2

### Create your Serverless Days CFP

**What is [Serverless Days](https://serverlessdays.io/)**

ServerlessDays are a family of events around the world focused on fostering a community around serverless technologies. Bit Project will be hosting a the [Serverless Days: Student Edition](https://student.serverlessdays.io/) Conference where students around the world will present and demo their projects. This conference will highlight the top serverless projects that solve real world issues.

Once your final project proposal has been approved, you will begin working on your CFP for the conference.

The goal of this CFP is to convince the organizers that your project will do a great job of demonstrating the use of serverless architecture and is a project that can be used by future students to learn serverless.
