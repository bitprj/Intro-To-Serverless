## Laying out the groundwork

### ✅  Task:

- [ ]  In your "Serverless Camp Project" figma file, create a flowchart showing the flow of information and components involved in your project including any Azure Functions and APIs you plan on using
- [ ]  Export the flowchart as a png file
- [ ]  Upload the flowchart into a new folder called "project" (where you will be saving all of your project related files) and commit your changes to move on

### Converting the checklist into a flowchart
1. Create a circular shape/block for each of the components and write their names inside their designated shape
2. Draw lines on all of the technologies that interact with each other
3. Near each line, use the previous bullet points you wrote to describe the relationship between the technologies starting with action verbs (e.g. between JS code/front-end --> Azure Function "Sends an HTTP Post Request with uploaded image)
