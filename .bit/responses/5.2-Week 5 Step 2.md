## Develop a Solution

Now that you know what problem you want to resolve, and keeping your category in mind, we need to determine the scope of your solution. Start by doing some research into APIs that relate back to your problem statement.

üëâ Here's an [API list](https://apilist.fun/) that you can filter through.

Here are some leading questions you can ask yourself to help make a decision:

üíª How can you use technology to resolve the problem?

‚ö°Ô∏è What APIs did you find that would be correlated to the problem?

ü§î What type of solution would other people who face this problem want?

## :pencil: Task: What is your proposed solution for the problem? How are you using technology to develop this solution?
