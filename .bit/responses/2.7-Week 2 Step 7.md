## Week 2 Step 7

### Call the Face API P2: Using Fetch

![fetchapi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69332964/103604217-6e969280-4ede-11eb-8843-2df2bccae8fa.png)

*What is happening in this flowchart?*

**Azure Function:** We are now going to be using the Azure Function to send a POST request to the Face API Endpoint and receive emotion data. 

### Concepts to know:
* GET and POST requests
* Context
* Await and Promises
* Arrays (`parts[0]`)
* Headers
* [Javascript Object Properties](https://www.sitepoint.com/back-to-basics-javascript-object-syntax/#:~:text=Accessing%20Properties,followed%20by%20the%20property%20name.)

There are many ways to make a POST request, but to stay consistent, we're going to use the package  `node-fetch`. This package makes HTTP requests in a similar format as what we're going to use for the rest of the project. **Install the package using the same format we did for `parse-multipart`.**

```js
//install the node-fetch pacakge
var fetch = '<CODE HERE>'
```
Read through the [**API** section](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch#api) of the documentation. We're going to make a call using the `fetch(url, {options})` function.

We're calling the `fetch` function - notice the **await** keyword, which we need because `fetch` returns a **Promise**, which is a proxy for a value that isn't currently known. You can read about Javascript promises [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). 

Javascript is what we call a "synchronous" language, meaning operations in Javascript block other operations from executing until they are complete, creating a sense of single directional flow. This means that only one operation can happen at a time. However, in order to maximize efficiency (save time and resources), Javascript allows the use of asynchronous functions.

Can you guess what this means?

Simply put, async functions allow other operations to continue running as they are being executed [(read more)](https://dev.to/hardy613/asynchronous-vs-synchronous-programming-23ed). Promises are sychnronous objects, similar to their real life meaning, return a value at some point in the future, or a reason for why that value could not be returned - they represent the result of an async function that may or may not be resolved.

In the meantime, I've set the url for you- notice that it is just the uriBase with the params we specified earlier appended on.

For now, fill in the `method`  and `body`.  

```js
async function analyzeImage(img){
    
    const subscriptionKey = '<YOUR SUBSCRIPTION KEY>';
    const uriBase = '<YOUR ENDPOINT>' + '/face/v1.0/detect';

    let params = new URLSearchParams({
        'returnFaceId': 'true',
        'returnFaceAttributes': 'emotion'
    })

    
    //COMPLETE THE CODE
    let resp = await fetch(uriBase + '?' + params.toString(), {
        method: '<METHOD>',  //WHAT TYPE OF REQUEST?
        body: '<BODY>',  //WHAT ARE WE SENDING TO THE API?
        headers: {
            '<HEADER NAME>': '<HEADER VALUE>'  //do this in the next section
        }
    })

    let data = await resp.json();
    
    return data; 
}
```

Finally, we have to specify the request headers. Go back to the Face API documentation [here](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395236), and find the **Request headers** section. 

There are two headers that you need. I've provided the format below. Enter in the two header names and their two corresponding values. 

FYI: The `Content-Type`  header should be set to`'application/octet-stream'`.  This specifies a binary file.

```js
    //COMPLETE THE CODE
    let resp = await fetch(uriBase + '?' + params.toString(), {
        method: '<METHOD>',  //WHAT TYPE OF REQUEST?
        body: '<BODY>',  //WHAT ARE WE SENDING TO THE API?
      
      	//ADD YOUR TWO HEADERS HERE
        headers: {
            '<HEADER NAME>': '<HEADER VALUE>'
        }
    })
```

Lastly, we want to call the `analyzeImage` function in `module.exports`. Add the code below into `module.exports`.

Remember that `parts` represents the parsed multipart form data. It is an array of parts, each one described by a filename, a type and a data. Since we only sent one file, it is stored in index 0, and we want the `data`  property to access the binary file– hence `parts[0].data`. Then in the HTTP response of our Azure function, we store the result of the API call.

```js
//module.exports function

//analyze the image
var result = await analyzeImage(parts[0].data);

context.res = {
	body: {
		result
	}
};

console.log(result)
context.done(); 

```

**To move on, commit the code from your function to the repository. Once your function works, you will be able to move on!**
