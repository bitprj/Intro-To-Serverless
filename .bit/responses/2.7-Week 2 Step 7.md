## Week 2 Step 7
### Setting up the Twilio API
Twilio is a cloud communication platform used to **programmatically** send SMS messages, calls, etc. You will be using the Twillio API to send yourself information from the Face Data you obtained in the last issue.

### 📝 Task 7: Enable your Twilio account to send messages
You will need to buy a new number on Twilio. On a free trial, you have to verify each number that you send messages to or call. Set up phone number to be verified on your Twilio account.

> **Note**: Don't worry about paying for anything, you will be receiving **10 dollars of credit from Twilio**, which is more than enough for this project. Numbers should only cost 1 dollar.
