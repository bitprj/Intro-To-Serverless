### :computer: Computer Setup

<details>
<summary>Step by step instructions to setup your computer ‚ñ∂Ô∏è</summary>
<br>
 
1. Download or update to the newest version of MacOS or Windows.
> üö© If you are using Windows, it highly recommended that you use WSL. [Here's](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) how.  
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). If you are on Windows, you can install Git on Windows and it should come with WSL (Ubuntu). [Here's](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git) how. 
3. If you are running WSL(Ubuntu), open a WSL terminal and install curl with the following command:
```
 apt-get install curl
 ```
4. Ensure that you have a [Github](https://github.com/) account and make note of the email address that you used to sign up for the account.   
5. Download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for your operating system. 
> üö© If you are on Windows, [here's](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl#:~:text=From%20the%20WSL%20terminal%201%20Open%20a%20WSL,3%20Type%20code%20.%20...%20More%20items...%20) how to use VS Code with WSL
6. Enable Azure Account and Azure Functions extensions in VS Code. See below: 

![Azure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57218090/124665871-dff5d480-de72-11eb-86f0-35c3acf07db4.PNG)
<br>
7. Install homebrew if you're on Mac. You can find the instructions [here](https://brew.sh/)

Finally, you are ready for the setup script. Follow the steps listed below:

### If you're on Mac, open a terminal and run the following (otherwise skip to the next step): 
Run: 
```
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/var/homebrew
```

### Run the following command in your terminal (WSL terminal if you're on windows)
```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitprj/Intro-To-Serverless/fbec8b26e9b51152d389442d2d34dabc42d5923a/setup.sh)
```
The script should guide you much of the way._ Make sure to read the instructions it gives carefully. The script **will do the following automatically for you:**
- Checks if you already have an SSH key
- If not, it creates one for you, using your github email address.
- Copies the SSH key to your clipboard so you can paste it into your Github SSH key settings
- Installs Homebrew
- Sets up the folder structure and .bash_profile commands necessary to ensure nvm works correctly
- Uses nvm to install a version of Node which is compatible with Azure
- Sets up git command tab completion and modifies your terminal prompt to show your current git branch if you're inside a git repository.
- Closes the Terminal program to ensure that all changes are applied.

When everything completes successfully, close and re-open Terminal. Depending on your operating system, you may see the following insecure directories error message:
```
zsh compinit: insecure directories, run compaudit for list.
Ignore insecure directories and continue [y] or abort compinit [n]? yzsh compinit: insecure directories, run compaudit for list.
Ignore insecure directories and continue [y] or abort compinit [n]? y%     ~ $ 
```
Type ‚Äòy‚Äô two times
Run compaudit to see the affected directories
you may then see:
```
There are insecure directories:
/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
/usr/local/share/zsh
```
If this happens on Mac, run these commands and you should see the error message(s) cleared
```
sudo chown -R yourusername /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
sudo chown -R yourusername /usr/local/share/zsh
compaudit
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installing VS Code Extensions

<details>
<summary>Step by step instructions to install the Vscode extensions ‚ñ∂Ô∏è </summary>
The features that Visual Studio Code includes out-of-the-box are just the start. VS Code extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow. 
 
Take a look at these [instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace) on how to install VS Code extensions. If you already forked the Intro-To-Serverless repo, and opened it in Vs Code, you may have gotten a pop-up  which recommended some extensions. Some of the extensions we will need are:
 
- [Azure Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint). 
- [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer)
 
 > Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IGVeq2DdsA) on how to use ESLint with VS Code.

### :x: The Step Failed. What do I do?
No worries, we all make mistakes - now is the time to fix it! The CounselorBot will provide feedback on what went wrong with your code.

<details>
<summary>Step by step instructions on how to view feedback ‚ñ∂Ô∏è </summary>

First, click on `Actions` at the top of your repository.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69332964/120932906-b4da6280-c6c5-11eb-97f8-b8311c72eabb.png)

Next, find the commit that failed. You can identify it by the name you called the commit. **Click on it!**
<img width="1019" alt="Screen Shot 2021-06-06 at 12 51 31 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69332964/120933012-3cc06c80-c6c6-11eb-9ca9-f3b19a8bb0b8.png">

Now, go ahead and click on ":x: build"
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69332964/120933055-68435700-c6c6-11eb-88a9-af248114c6a9.png)

The step that failed **should expand** and you'll see feedback at the bottom. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69332964/120935920-09380f00-c6d3-11eb-89fe-eec0983fa226.png)

For this one, the feedback was:
```
Error: Got: "hello world", was expecting: "Hello World". 
```
In this case, the student should probably take another look at the capitalization in their code.

</details>

> :bulb: Using this feedback, fix your code. Every time you commit, the action will run again to check your code!

### :question: Can I run a check on my own computer?

<details>
<summary>Running local checks ‚ñ∂Ô∏è</summary>
Yes! You absolutely can. Here is how to configure VScode to allow local checking. This is optional, and is useful if you want to check your code without first commiting for the counselor bot to check. 

1. Go into the `.vscode` folder and click into the `launch.json` file. 
2. Edit the `launch.json` file to be:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Attach to Node Functions",
            "type": "node",
            "request": "attach",
            "port": 9229,
            "preLaunchTask": "func: host start"
        },
        {
            "name": "Run Tests",
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "program": "${workspaceRoot}/.bit/tests/test.${input:week}.${input:step}.js",
            "envFile": "${workspaceRoot}/.env",
            "preLaunchTask": "func: host start"
        }    
    ],
    "inputs": [
        {
          "id": "week",
          "description": "Please select the current week as a number",
          "type": "pickString",
          "options": ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
        },
        {
            "id": "step",
            "description": "Please enter the current step as a number",
            "type": "pickString",
            "options": ["1", "2", "3", "4","5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "11"],
        }
    ]
}
```
3. Create a `.env` file to the root of your project. If done correctly, the `.env` file will show up next to the `.funcignore` file. 
4. Add all the secrets you have in GitHub for that step and any Azure function settings you have in Azure to the `.env` file in the format:
```json
KEY=value
KEY2=value2
```
5. You are all setup. To run this go to the "Run and Debug" tab on the left panel. At the top, where it says, `Attach to Node Functions`, click the dropdown and select `Run Tests`. Now, you can click the green arrow, and follow the prompted steps to test your function locally!

‚ÄºÔ∏è This is not required, as you can always commit your code to the counselor bot to check, but is definitely good to know.
